Jan lives in a seacoast town in Massachusetts, close to where she grew up. During the summer her family moves to a home in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts.PreSchool-Grade 2-Eve Bunting's tender Valentine tale (Clarion, 1983) is nicely presented in this well-done book/tape combination. Mrs. Bear has a surprise in store for Mr. Bear. She's gotten up during hibernation just so they can celebrate a special Valentine's Day. Her preparations show the love she has for Mr. Bear. Mr. Bear, as it turns out, has some surprises of his own. Together they share a special day before once again settling down for a long sleep. The female narrator reads the gently humorous story well, creating individual voices for both of the Bears. Light background music changes to accent story action, enhancing the words. Some minor sound effects are also included. This is a nice presentation that would make a good listening center, and not just in February.<br><i>Teresa Bateman, Brigadoon Elementary School, Federal Way, WA</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Quinn is his brother's opposite -- a thrill-seeker who's always chasing the next scary rush, no matter what the cost. But Quinn and Blake are in for the surprise of their lives when they're thrust into the world of a bizarre phantom carnival -- and their souls are the price of admission. <br><br>In order to save his brother, and himself, Blake must survive seven different carnival rides before dawn. Seven rides...it sounds easy. But each ride is full of unexpected dangers, because each ride is a reflection of one of Blake's deepest fears. And the last ride is the worst one of all. Because that's the one that confronts Blake with a terrifying secret from his past -- a secret he's been running from for years. <br><br>Full of roller-coaster twists and turns, Neal Shusterman's latest page-turner is an Orpheus-like adventure into one boy's psyche.</p><p>Neal Shusterman is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of more than thirty award-winning books for children, teens, and adults, including The Unwind Dystology, The Skinjacker trilogy,&nbsp;<i>Downsiders</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Challenger</i>&nbsp;<i>Deep</i>, which won the National Book Award.&nbsp;<i>Scythe</i>, the first book in his newest series Arc of a Scythe, is a Michael L.

I wasn't sure where on the roller coaster he lost it because I didn't ride with him; my friends, Russ and Maggie, did. I had volunteered to wait in line for Icewater Rapids. </p><p> "What a nice guy," Maggie had said, giving me a peck on the cheek. Well, nice guy or not, I had my own reasons. </p><p> The loss of Quinn's hat was the first trauma of the evening, but not the first of Quinn's life. Whole galaxies of traumas revolved around my brother. I knew he wouldn't part with his hat easily; it was one of his prized possessions -- a black baseball cap with a very distinctive design on its face. Not the insignia of a sports team or a designer logo -- that wouldn't do for Quinn. No, his hat featured a rude cartoon of a hand with its middle finger up. He loved that hat because he could flip everyone off on a continual basis. </p><p> He was still grumbling about his loss as he, Maggie, and Russ joined me in the line for Icewater Rapids. </p><p> "There should be catch-nets beneath the ride," Quinn complained. "They're gonna pay. Russ should have caught it -- he was behind me!" As if the whole world were to blame. </p><p> "Ignore him and maybe he'll go away," Russ said, waving his beefy arm dismissively. Russ is what you might call a disenfranchised jock. He muscles up regularly, lifting weights, but never lasts more than a month in any of the sports he's tried, because he loses interest too quickly. Maybe that's because so many of the other guys on teams just try to impress the girls, while Russ had no need: He and Maggie had been dating since the beginning of recorded time, with no end in sight. </p><p> As for Maggie, she couldn't have cared less about Quinn's ravings. She checked herself out in a tall mirror -- one of several distractions placed in the long line to break up the monotony. "Tell me the truth, do I look fat to you?" she asked me. </p><p> "You're kidding, right?" </p><p> "No, seriously." </p><p> Russ just laughed. </p><p> "Maggie, it's a fun-house mirror. Of course you look fat. That's the point." </p><p> She sighed. "I know that, but fun-house mirrors never usually make me look <i>this</i> fat." </p><p> "Scootch down a bit," Russ said, "and you'll be fat in all the right places." </p><p> She poked him in the stomach for that one. Warped mirrors aside, Maggie was slim and nice looking. Smart, too. But to hear her talk, you'd think she was dumb and ugly, always comparing herself to the other girls in school. </p><p> "Congratulations," I told her, glancing once more at the mirror. "I always said you've got a distorted view of yourself. Now you really do." </p><p> She threw me a twisted grin, and Russ, thinking the grin was meant for him, clamped his muscular arm around Maggie's waist. I sometimes wondered if Maggie got bruises from the way Russ held her -- like, if he let go, she might get away. </p><p> You're probably wondering how I fit into this little high school equation. Well, I suppose if the others are variables, I'm the constant. Constantly studying, constantly busy, constantly shuttling from swim team to debate team to home with the regularity of a celestial clock. </p><p> "That's what I like about you," Russ once told me. "You've got a level head -- and I don't mean just the haircut." </p><p> As far as the equation went, I'd be out of it soon, on account of the way I tested out of high school. Not that I'm a genius or anything. I'm just a mix of a little bit of brains, a whole lot of studying, and a knack for multiple-choice tests. Blend that with a single parent earning minimum wage, and you get a scholarship to New York's Columbia University at sixteen. I was scheduled to leave next month, right after summer vacation, skipping my senior year of high school entirely. </p><p> "Columbia?" Russ had said. "Wow, I didn't even know you spoke Spanish!" </p><p> Maggie had told me he was kidding, but we both knew he wasn't. Let's face it, if my bulb was halogen, Russ had an energy saver. But that's okay. He had other things going for him. Like his easygoing personality. Like Maggie. </p><p> Me, I was between girlfriends. So when we took our little road trip to Six Flags, instead of a date, I ended up with Quinn. </p><p> I turned around, noticing that Quinn had stopped grumbling about his hat. That's because he was gone. </p><p> "Forget about him," Russ said. "He'll turn up eventually, and even if he doesn't, no great loss." </p><p> I shook my head. "If he gets into trouble, we'll all get ejected from the park." Which happened once before, when Quinn took an M-80 and blew up an animatronic mime. </p><p> "You know that's what he wants," Maggie said, "to make us all look for him." </p><p> "He's a waste of life," said Russ, and it annoyed me. <i>I</i> was the only one allowed to call Quinn a waste of life. </p><p> "Next time bring a metal detector," Maggie suggested. "Easiest way to find him." </p><p> I laughed at that. She was, of course, referring to Quinn's many facial accessories. Studs, rings, and dangling things. They weren't just in his ears, but in his eyebrows and nose. He had one in his lip, too. Call me old-fashioned, but I figure a thirteen-year-old like Quinn could get away with one, maybe two rings before maxing out the face-to-metal ratio. </p><p> I asked Russ and Maggie to wait for me when they were done with the raft ride. Then I wound my way out of the line until I came to a wide pathway that was almost as crowded as the line. In an amusement park this big, I knew if I let him get too far away, I'd never find him. And Maggie was right; he'd like that just fine. He'd ruin my night by making me worry where he was and what kind of crazy thing he was doing, then he'd show up at the car an hour after closing, with a smug grin stretched across his ring-filled face. </p><p> <i>Fine, let him get lost,</i> I told myself. <i>I don't care.</i> But the problem was, I did care, and that annoyed me even more. </p><p> For a long time everyone thought Quinn was autistic. Hard to believe that, looking at him now. Now he was just a self-centered royal pain. But when he was a baby, he would turn all his attention inward, never making eye contact with anyone. He was almost three and a half before he even spoke. It happened right before our parents split up. We went to one of those cheesy carnivals that came to town every year. Dad took us on a kiddie coaster. Quinn smiled -- and back then Quinn never smiled. Then, when the little ride grinded to a halt, Quinn spoke. </p><p> "Daddy, more." </p><p> We were speechless. Until then Quinn had never put a coherent thought together. It was as if the ride had stimulated something in my brother that had always been dormant. Dad moved out a few weeks later. It was on the night of our annual viewing of <i>The Wizard of Oz,</i> just about the time that Almira Gulch turns into the Wicked Witch of the West. I still can't watch that movie without getting a sick feeling in my stomach, like it's my own house spinning inside of a tornado. </p><p> Our father probably would have left a few years earlier had Quinn not been born. Quinn wasn't planned. He was an "accident." Enough of an accident to keep Dad around until Quinn was three. Since he left, our lives have been a roller coaster of Mom's raging romances with men who weren't good to her, or to us. </p><p> As for Quinn, that first ride opened the door to bigger things. Stimulation and saturation. His life was a festival of excess that could not be contained. Deafening music, eye-popping bright colors, sugar added to almost everything he ate. Quinn's life was a bullet in a barrel ready to explode. </p><p> I searched the amusement park for fifteen minutes before I found him. I would have found him sooner had I been thinking like a lunatic, to whom breaking laws is a lifestyle choice. </p><p> About a dozen people stood in the middle of a wide pathway, looking up at something. I followed their gaze to some imbecile climbing the support scaffolding of a roller coaster. He was at least fifty feet high and leaned dangerously toward a piece of cloth wedged between two crossbeams. It was a hat. That's when I realized that the imbecile and I came from the same gene pool. And the law my brother was trying to break now was the law of gravity. </p><p> "Is that part of the Spider-Man show, Mommy?" I heard a little kid next to me ask. I hurried toward the roller coaster, ready to kill my brother, if he didn't do the job himself. </p><p><br> "Have I ever told you what a psycho you are?" </p><p> I stood on the exit stairs of the Raptor, looking out at Quinn, who clung to the support beam about six feet away from me. I looked around to see if any guards had noticed him out there, but for the moment Quinn's antics had found a security blind spot. </p><p> "Hey, <i>defib,</i> okay? I had to get my hat." He stretched his hand out toward it, but it was still just out of his reach. </p><p> "Did you ever consider engaging your brain?" I easily grabbed the hat from where I stood on the exit stairs. </p><p> He sneered at me, but he did seem a bit red in the face. "Oh, sure, do things the easy way." There was something else about him too. Not now, but when I'd first arrived. I'd seen the way he'd reached for his hat, as if he weren't hanging fifty feet above the asphalt. As if he didn't notice where he was until I'd brought it to his attention. There were times that he sort of slipped out of phase with reality -- a holdover, I guess, from those early years when he was so locked in his own private universe. It wasn't just that he didn't see the big picture. Sometimes he saw a different picture entirely. </p><p> Now Quinn looked down, taking stock of his situation, and shrugged, swinging to another girder closer to the stairs, still using the ride's infrastructure as his own personal jungle gym. </p><p> "Isn't it enough that you drive Mom crazy?" I asked him. "Is it such a stretch for you to be normal just this once?" </p><p> He tossed his head, flinging a lock of his uneven hair out of his face. "If that's what you are, I'd rather be deviant." </p><p> Unable to reach the railing of the stairs from where he hung, he grabbed a bar above his head and let his legs swing free, as if the fifty-foot drop beneath him were nothing. A sizable crowd had gathered below, gawking and pointing. </p><p> That's when I noticed the vibration. I felt it in the staircase railing before I heard or saw it: a shuddering of metal crashing downhill. It came to me in an instant what I already knew but had forgotten until that moment. </p><p> The Raptor was a hanging roller coaster. The bars Quinn dangled from were part of the track. </p><p> Quinn realized it too, and he tried to swing himself closer to the railing but didn't have enough momentum. </p><p> All at once the train swung around an outside curve, its riders screaming with joy, completely unaware of my idiot brother directly in their path. </p><p> I leaned out as far as I could, grabbed Quinn by the waist, and wrenched him from the hanging track. I almost lost him, but I got enough of him over the rail to flip him onto the stairs. We tumbled on the steps, while just past the railing, the Raptor sliced past, a blur of green and black, gone in an instant. </p><p> I should have been relieved, but saving Quinn was such a regular pastime for me, all I could feel was anger. "I'm tired of saving your friggin' butt," I told him, although <i>friggin'</i> and <i>butt</i> weren't exactly the words I used. </p><p> Then his eyes glazed over for a second. </p><p> "I go places sometimes," he told me, his voice as thready and distant as his eyes. "Don't know why I go places...I just do." </p><p> It caught me off guard. He was around six the last time he said that. It was a whisper at bedtime, like a confession. A secret, too fragile for the light of day. <i>I go places sometimes.</i> </p><p> But right then I wasn't feeling too sensitive. "Next time you go, bring me back a shirt." He snapped out of whatever state he was in, and something inside him closed up like a camera shutter. He glanced defiantly at the ride that had almost turned him into roadkill, then looked back to me. </p><p> "Nice save, bro." Then he put on his hat, effectively flipping me off without lifting a finger. </p><p><br> Copyright � 2003 by Neal Shusterman</p></p><h2>Broken Crayons Still Color</h2><p>Many times what we see as our biggest regrets, failures and mistakes become what God uses the most in our lives.<br><br>God transforms our brokenness into something more beautiful than we can even imagine.

Readers will delight anew in the thrilling adventures of young Matthias as he discovers the hero within. Brian Jacques? classic tale of peaceful creatures forced to band together in battle has never felt more timely or full of life.</p><p>"I sometimes think it ironic for an ex-seaman, longshoreman, truck driver, policeman, bus driver, etc., to find success writing children's novels," says Brian Jacques (pronounced "Jakes"). Yet it is all too true. With the publication of his first children's book in 1987, the award-winning <b>Redwall</b>, Jacques' fresh talent has received exceptional praise from reviewers in the United States and England. Newbery Award winner Lloyd Alexander called it "a fine work, literate, witty, filled with the excitement of genuine storytelling. Young people will surely be captivated. I hope they give their elders a chance to share the delights."<p>A well-known radio personality in his native Liverpool--as well as an actor, stand-up comic, and playwright--Brian Jacques is the host of "Jakestown" on BBC Radio Merseyside. Ever the performer, Jacques is well-known for applying his acting and entertainment background to his lively presentations to legions of young fans at schools across the United States and England.</p><p><b>Brian Jacques</b> was born in Liverpool, England on June 15th, 1939. Along with forty percent of the population of Liverpool, his ancestral roots are in Ireland, County Cork to be exact.</p><p>He grew up in the area around the Liverpool docks. His interest in adventure stories began at an early age with reading the books of: Daniel Defoe, Sir Henry Rider Haggard, Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Thomas Malory, Robert Michael Ballantyne, Robert Louis Stevenson, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Kenneth Grahame. He attended St. John's School, an inner city school that had its playground on the roof. On his first day at St. John's, at the age of ten, he had an experience that marked his potential as a writer. When given an assignment of writing a story about animals, he wrote about the bird that cleaned a crocodile's teeth. The teacher could not, and would not, believe that a ten year old could write that well. When young Brian refused to falsely say that he had copied the story, he was caned as "a liar". He had always loved to write, but it was only then, that he realized that he had a talent for writing.</p><p>Some teachers at St. John's proved to be good role models. As Mr. Jacques recalls:</p><p>"My favourite teacher was Mr. Austin Thomas. He looked like Lee Marvin. Big Man. A Captain in World War II. He came to school on a big bush bike with the haversack on back. He was a man's man. Always fair. I was fourteen at the time when Mr. Thomas introduced the class to poetry and Greek literature. (Because of him, I saved seven shillings and sixpence to buy <b>The Iliad</b> and <b>The Odyssey</b> at this dusty used book shop.)"</p><p>This interest in poetry extended to Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Goldsmith.It was also at St. John's that Brian met a teacher, Alan Durband (who also taught two Beatles, Paul McCartney and George Harrison), who, more than thirty years later would bring about a major change in his life.</p><p>After Brian finished school at fifteen, he set out to find adventure as a merchant seaman. He travelled to many far away ports, including New York, Valparaiso, San Francisco, and Yokohama. Tiring of the lonely life of a sailor, he returned to Liverpool where he worked as a railway fireman, a longshoreman, a long-distance truck driver, a bus driver, a boxer, a bobby (Police Constable 216D), a postmaster, and a stand-up comic.</p><p></p><p><b>Penguin mourns the passing of celebrated children&#x2019;s book author Brian Jacques</b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Attack on Titan 15</h2><p>FUGITIVES AND PRISONERS<br>Hange&#x2019;s interrogation of a Military Police squad has revealed that Krista (a.k.a.

In time he realized that his life could have purpose: that he was to be a witness, the one who would pass on the account of what had happened so that the dead would not have died in vain and so the living could learn.&#x201d; <i>Night</i>, which has sold millions of copies around the world<i>, </i>is the very embodiment of that conviction. It is written in simple, understated language, yet it is emotionally devastating, never to be forgotten.</p><p>Born in the town of Sighet, Transylvania, Wiesel was a teenager when he and his family were deported to Auschwitz and then Buchenwald. <i>Night </i>is the shattering record of his memories of the death of his mother, father, and little sister, Tsipora; the death of his own innocence; and his despair as a deeply observant Jew confronting the absolute evil of man. &#x201c;Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, that turned my life into one long night,&#x201d; writes Wiesel. &#x201c;Never shall I forget . . . even were I condemned to live as long as God Himself.&#x201d; These words are etched into the wall of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Far more than a chronicle of the sadistic realm of the camps, <i>Night</i> also addresses many of the philosophical and personal questions implicit in any serious consideration of the Holocaust.</p><p>The memorial edition of<i> Night </i>includes the unpublished text of a speech that Wiesel delivered before the United Nations General Assembly on the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz entitled &#x201c;Will the World Ever Know.&#x201d; These remarks powerfully resonate with <i>Night</i> and with subsequent acts of genocide.</p></p><p><b>Elie Wiesel</b> (1928&#x2013;2016) is the author of more than sixty books. <i>Night</i>, first published in Yiddish in 1955, was selected for Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club in 2006, and continues to be an important reminder of man&#x2019;s capacity for evil. For his literary and human rights activities, he has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal, and the National Humanities Medal. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986."<i>Night </i>is a slender book...But it packs a whole world--perhaps better, a whole inferno--into that brief span...A classic work of literature from that darkest of eras...it deserves to be read and reread for decades to come." --<i>Kirkus</i> (starred review)</p><h2>The 8-Hour Sleep Paradox: How We Are Sleeping Our Way to Fatigue, Disease and Unhappiness</h2><p><b>The #1 Amazon Best Seller</b><br>Could you be living with an undiagnosed disease that is making you fat, tired, grumpy, unproductive and depressed?<br>If you...<br><ul><li>Wake up exhausted every morning, even though you're getting your 7-8 hours</li><li>Blame your lack of energy on your busy lifestyle or getting older...</li><li>Have been told your snoring sounds like a freight train...</li><li>Grind or clench your teeth...</li><li>Are truly terrified to give up coffee...</li></ul>You may be one of the 42 million Americans battling the most urgent epidemic of our time--sleep apnea.

He is also the author of the fantasy novel <i>Hunt for the Mayan Looking-Glass</i>, available as an eBook.&nbsp;He lives in Annapolis, Maryland, with his wife and youngest child.Darkness was encroaching on Cato Neimoidia&#x2019;s western hemisphere, though exchanges of coherent light high above the beleaguered world ripped looming night to shreds. Well under the fractured sky, in an orchard of manax trees that studded the lower ramparts of Viceroy Gunray&#x2019;s majestic redoubt, companies of clone troopers and battle droids were slaughtering one another with bloodless precision.<br> <br>A flashing fan of blue energy lit the undersides of a cluster of trees: the lightsaber of Obi-Wan Kenobi. <br><br>Attacked by two sentry droids, Obi-Wan stood his ground, twisting his upraised blade right and left to swat blaster bolts back at his enemies. Caught midsection by their own salvos, both droids came apart, with a scattering of alloy limbs. <br><br>Obi-Wan moved again. <br><br>Tumbling under the segmented thorax of a Neimoidian harvester beetle, he sprang to his feet and raced forward. Explosive light shunted from the citadel&#x2019;s deflector shield dappled the loamy ground between the trees, casting long shadows of their buttressed trunks. Oblivious to the chaos occurring in their midst, columns of the five-meter-long harvesters continued their stalwart march toward a mound that supported the fortress. In their cutting jaws or on their upsweeping backs they carried cargoes of pruned foliage. The crushing sounds of their ceaseless gnawing provided an eerie cadence to the rumbling detonations and the hiss and whine of blaster bolts. <br><br>From off to Obi-Wan&#x2019;s left came a sudden click of servos; to his right, a hushed cry of warning. <br><br>&#x201c;Down, Master!&#x201d; <br><br>He dropped into a crouch even before Anakin&#x2019;s lips formed the final word, lightsaber aimed to the ground to keep from impaling his onrushing former Padawan. A blur of thrumming blue energy sizzled through the humid air, followed by a sharp smell of cauterized circuitry, the tang of ozone. A blaster discharged into soft soil, then the stalked, elongated head of a battle droid struck the ground not a meter from Obi-Wan&#x2019;s feet, sparking as it bounced and rolled out of sight, repeating: <i>&#x201c;Roger, roger . . . Roger, roger . . .&#x201d; <br></i><br>In a tuck, Obi-Wan pivoted on his right foot in time to see the droid&#x2019;s spindly body collapse. The fact that Anakin had saved his life was nothing new, but Anakin&#x2019;s blade had passed a little too close for comfort. Eyes somewhat wide with surprise, he came to his feet. <br><br>&#x201c;You nearly took my head off.&#x201d; <br><br>Anakin held his blade to one side. In the strobing light of battle his blue eyes shone with wry amusement. &#x201c;Sorry, Master, but your head was where my lightsaber needed to go.&#x201d; <br><br><i>Master. <br></i><br>Anakin used the honorific not as learner to teacher, but as Jedi Knight to Jedi Council member. The braid that had defined his earlier status had been ritually severed after his audacious actions at Praesitlyn. His tunic, knee-high boots, and tight-fitting trousers were as black as the night. His face scarred from a contest with Dooku-trained Asajj Ventress. His mechanical right hand sheathed in an elbow-length glove. He had let his hair grow long the past few months, falling almost to his shoulders now. His face he kept clean-shaven, unlike Obi-Wan, whose strong jaw was defined by a short beard. <br>&#x201c;I suppose I should be grateful your lightsaber <i>needed </i>to go there, rather than desired to.&#x201d; <br><br>Anakin&#x2019;s grin blossomed into a full-fledged smile. &#x201c;Last time I checked we were on the same side, Master.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Still, if I&#x2019;d been a moment slower . . .&#x201d; <br><br>Anakin booted the battle droid&#x2019;s blaster aside. &#x201c;Your fears are only in your mind.&#x201d; <br><br>Obi-Wan scowled. &#x201c;Without a head I wouldn&#x2019;t have much mind left, now, would I?&#x201d; He swept his lightsaber in a flourishing pass, nodding up the alley of manax trees. &#x201c;After you.&#x201d; <br><br>They resumed their charge, moving with the supernatural speed and grace afforded by the Force, Obi-Wan&#x2019;s brown cloak swirling behind him. Victims of the initial bombardment, scores of battle droids lay sprawled on the ground. Others dangled like broken marionettes from the branches of the trees into which they had been hurled. <br><br>Areas of the leafy canopy were in flames. <br><br>Two scorched droids little more than arms and torsos lifted their weapons as the Jedi approached, but Anakin only raised his left hand in a Force push that shoved the droids flat onto their backs. <br><br>They jinked right, somersaulting under the wide bodies of two harvester beetles, then hurdling a tangle of barbed underbrush that had managed to anchor itself in the otherwise meticulously tended orchard. They emerged from the tree line at the shore of a broad irrigation canal, fed by a lake that delimited the Neimoidians&#x2019; citadel on three sides. In the west a trio of wedge-shaped <i>Venator</i>-class assault cruisers hung in scudding clouds. North and east the sky was in turmoil, crosshatched with ion trails, turbolaser beams, hyphens of scarlet light streaming upward from weapons emplacements outside the citadel&#x2019;s energy shield. Rising from high ground at the end of the peninsula, the tiered fastness was reminiscent of the command towers of the Trade Federation core ships, and indeed had been the inspiration for them. <br><br>Somewhere inside, trapped by Republic forces, were the Trade Federation elite. <br><br>With his homeworld threatened and the purse worlds of Deko and Koru Neimoidia devastated, Viceroy Gunray would have been wiser to retreat to the Outer Rim, as other members of the Separatist Council were thought to be doing. But rational thinking had never been a Neimoidian strong suit, especially when possessions remained on Cato Neimoidia the viceroy apparently couldn&#x2019;t live without. Backed by a battle group of Federation warships, he had slipped onto Cato Neimoidia, intent on looting the citadel before it fell. But Republic forces had been lying in wait, eager to capture him alive and bring him to justice&#x2013;thirteen years late, in the judgment of many. <br><br>Cato Neimoidia was as close to Coruscant as Obi-Wan and Anakin had been in almost four standard months, and with the last remaining Separatist strongholds now cleared from the Core and Colonies, they expected to be back in the Outer Rim by week&#x2019;s end. <br><br>Obi-Wan heard movement on the far side of the irrigation canal. <br><br>An instant later, four clone troopers crept from the tree line on the opposite bank to take up firing positions amid the water-smoothed rocks that lined the ditch. Far behind them a crashed gunship was burning. Protruding from the canopy, the LAAT&#x2019;s blunt tail was stenciled with the eight-rayed battle standard of the Galactic Republic. <br><br>A gunboat glided into view from downstream, maneuvering to where the Jedi were waiting. Standing in the bow, a clone commander named Cody waved hand signals to the troopers on shore and to others in the gunboat, who immediately fanned out to create a safe perimeter. <br><br>Troopers could communicate with one another through the comlinks built into their T-visored helmets, but the Advanced Recon Commando teams had created an elaborate system of gestures meant to thwart enemy attempts at eavesdropping. <br><br>A few nimble leaps brought Cody face-to-face with Obi-Wan and Anakin. <br><br>&#x201c;Sirs, I have the latest from airborne command.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Show us,&#x201d; Anakin said. <br><br>Cody dropped to one knee, his right hand activating a device built into his left wrist gauntlet. A cone of blue light emanated from the device, and a hologram of task force commander Do-donna resolved. <br><br>&#x201c;Generals Kenobi and Skywalker, provincial recon unit reports that Viceroy Gunray and his entourage are making their way to the north side of the redoubt. Our forces have been hammering at the shield from above and from points along the shore, but the shield generator is in a hardened site, and difficult to get at. Gunships are taking heavy fire from turbolaser cannons in the lower ramparts. If your team is still committed to taking Gunray alive, you&#x2019;re going to have to skirt those defenses and find an alternative way into the palace. At this point we cannot reinforce, repeat, cannot reinforce.&#x201d; <br><br>Obi-Wan looked at Cody when the hologram had faded. &#x201c;Suggestions, Commander?&#x201d; <br><br>Cody made an adjustment to the wrist projector, and a 3-D schematic of the redoubt formed in midair. <br><br>&#x201c;Assuming that Gun-ray&#x2019;s fortress is similar to what we found on Deko and Koru, the underground levels will contain fungus farms and processing and shipment areas. There will be access from the shipping areas into the midlevel grub hatcheries, and from the hatcheries we&#x2019;ll be able to infiltrate the upper reaches.&#x201d; <br><br>Cody carried a short-stocked DC-15 blaster rifle and wore the white armor and imaging system helmet that had come to symbolize the Grand Army of the Republic&#x2013;grown, nurtured, and trained on the remote world of Kamino, three years earlier. Just now, though, areas of white showed only where there were no smears of mud or dried blood, no gouges, abrasions, or charred patches. Cody&#x2019;s position was designated by orange markings on his helmet crest and shoulder guards. His upper right arm bore stripes signifying campaigns in which he had participated: Aagonar, Praesitlyn, Paracelus Minor, Antar 4, Tibrin, Skor II, and dozens of other worlds from Core to Outer Rim. <br><br>Over the years Obi-Wan had formed battlefield partnerships with several Advanced Recon Commandos&#x2013;Alpha, with whom he had been imprisoned on Rattatak, and Jangotat, on Ord Cestus. Early-generation ARCs had received training by the Mandalorian clone template, Jango Fett. While the Kaminoans had managed to breed some of Fett out of the regulars, they had been more selective in the case of the ARCs. As a consequence, ARCs displayed more individual initiative and leadership abilities. In short, they were more like the late bounty hunter himself, which was to say, more <i>human. </i>While Cody wasn&#x2019;t genetically an Advanced Recon Commando, he had ARC training and shared many ARC attributes. <br><br>In the initial stages of the war, clone troopers were treated no differently from the war machines they piloted or the weapons they fired. To many they had more in common with battle droids poured by the tens of thousands from Baktoid Armor Workshops on a host of Separatist-held worlds. But attitudes began to shift as more and more troopers died. The clones&#x2019; unfaltering dedication to the Republic, and to the Jedi, showed them to be true comrades in arms, and deserving of all the respect and compassion they were now afforded. It was the Jedi themselves, in addition to other progressive thinking officials in the Republic, who had urged that second- and third-generation troopers be given names rather than numbers, to foster a growing fellowship. <br><br>&#x201c;I agree that we can probably reach the upper levels, Commander,&#x201d; Obi-Wan said at last. &#x201c;But how do you propose we reach the fungus farms to begin with?&#x201d; <br><br>Cody stood to his full height and pointed toward the orchards. &#x201c;We go in with the harvesters.&#x201d; <br><br>Obi-Wan glanced uncertainly at Anakin and motioned him off to one side. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just the two of us. What do you think?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I think you worry too much, Master.&#x201d; <br><br>Obi-Wan folded his arms across his chest. &#x201c;And who&#x2019;ll worry about you if I don&#x2019;t?&#x201d; <br><br>Anakin canted his head and grinned. &#x201c;There are others.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You can only be referring to See-Threepio. And you had to <i>build </i>him.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Think what you will.&#x201d; <br><br>Obi-Wan narrowed his eyes with purpose. &#x201c;Oh, I see. But I would have thought Senator Amidala of greater interest to you than Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.&#x201d; Before Anakin could respond, he added: &#x201c;Despite that she&#x2019;s a politician also.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think I haven&#x2019;t tried to attract her interest, Master.&#x201d; <br><br>Obi-Wan regarded Anakin for a moment. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s more, if Chancellor Palpatine had genuine concern for your welfare, he would have kept you closer to Coruscant.&#x201d; <br><br>Anakin placed his artificial hand on Obi-Wan&#x2019;s left shoulder. &#x201c;Perhaps, Master. But then, who would look after you?&#x201d;</p><h2>Introductory Calculus For Infants</h2><p>The storybook adventure of two friends as they explore the wonders of calculus.</p><p>Omi M.

Yet the reality was very different, as Kelcey Wilson-Lee shows in this vibrant account of the five daughters of the great English king, Edward I, often known as Longshanks.<br><br> The lives of these sisters&#x2015;Eleanora, Joanna, Margaret, Mary and Elizabeth&#x2015;ran the full gamut of experiences open to royal women in the Middle Ages. Living as they did in a courtly culture founded on romantic longing and brilliant pageantry, they knew that a princess was to be chaste yet a mother to many children, preferably sons; meek, yet able to influence a recalcitrant husband or even command a host of men-at-arms. Edward&#x2019;s daughters were of course expected to cement alliances and secure lands and territory by making great dynastic marriages, or endow religious houses with royal favor. But they also skillfully managed enormous households, navigated choppy diplomatic waters and promoted their family&#x2019;s cause throughout Europe&#x2015;and had the courage to defy their royal father. They might never wear the crown in their own right, but they were utterly confident of their crucial role in the spectacle of medieval kingship.<br><br> Drawing on a wide range of contemporary sources, <em>Daughters of Chivalr</em>y offers a rich portrait of these spirited Plantagenet women. With their libraries of beautifully illustrated psalters and tales of romance, their rich silks and gleaming jewels, we follow these formidable women throughout their lives and see them&#x2015;at long last&#x2015;shine from out of the shadows, revealing what it was to be a princess in the Age of Chivalry. 8 pages of color illustrations</p><p>Kelcey Wilson-Lee is a historian of Britain, its art, and its architecture.

The first tale comes from the early 1800's with the "The Beast in the Cave" featuring art by the legendary Jordi Bernet (Torpedo, JONAH HEX). Learn about the original American Vampire, Skinner Sweet, and his involvement in the brutal Indian Wars, and an ancient evil hidden in the heart of the Old West. Plus, more about the man Skinner used to call his best friend - James Book!<p>The second tale comes straight from 1950s America, where AMERICAN VAMPIRE is terrorizing the suburbs with hot rods, teenyboppers and fangs! "Death Race" focuses on ferocious new vampire hunter Travis Kidd - but what is his connection to Skinner Sweet? As the story comes to a violent end, a sworn enemy's identity is finally revealed, and lots of blood is spilled!</p><p>Writer Scott Snyder (BATMAN, SWAMP THING) and artist Rafael Albuquerque bring together even more threads to the complex tapestry that is the world of AMERICAN VAMPIRE.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This volume collects issues 19-27 of the original series.</p></p><p>Scott Snyder is the bestselling and award-winning writer of <i>Batman, American Vampire</i> and <i>Swamp Thing</i> as well as the short story collection <i>Voodoo Heart.&nbsp; </i>He teaches writing at Sarah Lawrence College, NYU and Columbia University. He lives on Long Island with his wife, Jeanie, and his sons Jack and Emmett.&nbsp; He is a dedicated and un-ironic fan of Elvis Presley.After a quick flashback to an early chapter in Skinner Sweet&#x2019;s pre-vampire life in the Union army (drawn by Spanish artist Bernet), the series returns to its main story line of new-breed bloodsuckers creeping through progressive American eras. We&#x2019;re in the 1950s now with a major new character, a leather-jacket-clad teen greaser armed with a sneer and a helluva cause: exterminating every last undead abomination he can sniff out. Snyder&#x2019;s become one of DC&#x2019;s most in-demand writers since beginning this series, and if it seems like his scripts are getting a bit thinner, that&#x2019;s easily outweighed by regular artist Albuquerque&#x2019;s consistently great, gory work. --Ian Chipman</p><h2>I&#39;m a Gnome!</h2><p><b><b>Fans of Mo Willems and Dev Petty's </b><b><i>I Don't Want to Be a Frog</i></b><b> will love this humorous tale about one gnome's journey to prove he is unlike the other magical creatures in the forest.</b></b><br><br>Join Gnome (that's spelled G-N-O-M-E--don't ask why the <i>G</i> is silent!) as he travels through the magical forest to attend the annual Gnome Festival.<br><br>Along the way he encounters elves, dwarves, trolls, and fairies.

In an era in which much of the US landscape has been littered by unimaginative, prefabricated structures, James L. Garvin tells owners and would-be owners of old buildings in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont what they need to know before they begin the restoration process. In wonderfully lucid prose, Garvin describes the production of the materials from which the buildings of northern New England were built, outlines the stylistic evolution of the region&#39;s structures from the early 1700s to World War II, and offers guidelines for dating old buildings. Focusing on domestic architecture, but including examples of public, commercial, religious, and industrial buildings, he offers custodians of buildings an understanding of the technologies embodied in these structures, answers questions about stylistic changes, and allows the architecture of northern New England to be understood for the first time with a technical depth that is already available for buildings in better-studied parts of the US. Written for both homeowners and those responsible for public and museum structures, this volume provides an understanding of the region&#39;s building history even as it specifically answers questions that most often perplex architects and preservationists. By offering all custodians of northern New England buildings a richer understanding of architectural style and structure, the book encourages the use of appropriate methods and materials in building conservation and rehabilitation. Generously illustrated throughout, the book is also an essential resource for anyone who is interested in American and New England architecture and the building trades, and for anyone who has ever wondered about the secrets and stories of old buildings.</p><p>8 1/2 x 11 trim. 150 illus. 45 figs. LC 00-010536From the book &#x2014; <p>&#x201c;Whether you love or merely tolerate your old house, it is well to approach the building with one truth firmly in mind. Human life is short. The life of a house is potentially limitless. Even in the youthful US, we have houses that have been sheltering families for three hundred years or more. </p><p>&#x201c;Barring disaster or imprudent neglect, your house is destined to outlive you. You are but one in a long line of custodians of the property&#x2014;a line that extends backward through the decades or centuries and forward to an indefinite future. </p><p>&#x201c;That being the case, let the changes you make to your property be additive rather than subtractive in nature. If you need a new kitchen or bathroom or furnace, install it. But wherever possible, install it in such a way as to preserve original features or fabric . . . Try to make your work add to the legacy of the past so that you can pass a dwelling of even greater value and comfort to the future. Remember that the number of old houses is finite, and diminishes each year. It is a privilege and responsiblity to own a piece of the past.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Papa Married a Mormon</h2><p>This story is loosely based on the true story of a Mormon who married a Catholic and lived in a small town Mormon community in the times of the old west.

A tale of true magic; the tale of <i>Moonheart.</i></p></p><p><b>Charles de Lint</b> pioneered the urban fantasy genre with critically acclaimed novels and stories set in and around the imaginary modern North American city of Newford: <i>The Onion Girl</i>, <i>Moonheart</i>, <i>The Ivory and the Horn</i>, and the collection <i>Moonlight and Vines</i>, for which he won the World Fantasy Award. Among de Lint's many other novels are <i>Mulengro</i>, <i>Into the Green</i>, and<i> The Little Country</i>.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sara Kendell once read somewhere that the tale of the world is like a tree. The tale, she understood, did not so much mean the niggling occurrences of daily life. Rather it encompassed the grand stories that caused some change in the world and were remembered in ensuing years as, if not histories, at least folktales and myths. By such reasoning, Winston Churchill could take his place in British folklore alongside the legendary Robin Hood; Merlin Ambrosius had as much validity as Martin Luther. The scope of their influence might differ, but they were all a part of the same tale.<br>Though in later years she never could remember who had written that analogy of tale to tree, the image stayed with her. It was so easy to envision:<br>Sturdily rooted in the past, the tale's branches spread out through the days to come. The many stories that make up its substance unfold from bud to leaf to dry memory and back again, event connecting event like the threadwork of a spider's web, so that each creature of the world plays its part, understanding only aspects of the overall narrative, and perceiving, each with its particular talents, only glimpses of the Great Mystery that underlies it all.<br>The stories on their own are many, too myriad to count, and their origins are often too obscure or inconsequential on their own to be recognized for what they are. The Roman statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero said it best: "The beginnings of all things are small."<br>Though he lived and died some two thousand years before Sara was born, and though the tale was so entangled by the time she came into it that it would have been an exercise in futility to attempt to unravel its many threads, Sara herself came to agree with Cicero. Years later she could pinpoint the exact moment that brought her into the tale. It was when she found the leather pouch with its curious contents in one of the back storerooms of her uncle's secondhand shop.<br>* * *<br>The Merry Dancers Old Book and Antique Emporium was situated on Bank Street, between Third Avenue and Fourth in the area of Ottawa called the Glebe. It was owned by Jamie Tams who took his inspiration for the name from the aurora borealis, the northern lights that the French call <i>les ch�vres dansantes</i>. The dancing goats.<br>"It's quite appropriate," he told Sara one day. He was leaning on the long display case that supported the relic of a cash register which worked by turning a crank on its side. "Think about it. The Arctic's what? Ice and snow. Tundra and miles of nothing at best. Who'd expect a treasure like the Dancers in a place like that?"<br>Sara smiled. "Are you implying that somewhere in all this junk there're similar treasures to be found?"<br>"Implying? Nope. It's a straight fact. When was the last time you went through the jumble of boxes in the back rooms? There could be anything in them--not valuable, mind, but treasures all the same."<br>He stared pointedly at Sara's typewriter, an IBM self-correcting Selectric, and the pile of paper that was stacked beside it.<br>"If you weren't so busy writing the Great Canadian Novel..."<br>"What sorts of things?" Sara wanted to know. "Like Aladdin's lamp?"<br>"You never can tell."<br>"I suppose not."<br>"And," Jamie finished triumphantly, "if you never look, you'll never know either!"<br>Sara tried, but she couldn't keep a straight face any longer. They both broke into laughter.<br>Neither of them needed to work--at least not for financial considerations. Jamie in his time, and now Sara in hers, ran The Merry Dancers as a hobby. That it showed any sort of a profit at all at the end of each fiscal year was as much due to luck as through any particular effort on their part, though Sara was more conscientious in her management than Jamie'd ever been. ("Comes with being young," Jamie warned her darkly. "Wait'll you get older. The whole place'll fall to pieces around you as you go doddering about. You'll see.")<br>It was a standing joke between them that whenever Jamie visited the store, at one point or another, he'd play the concerned proprietor. But for all the teasing, they both knew that if they ever made the shop as tidy as some of the newer ones on the street, it would lose half of its charm.<br>The Merry Dancers was cluttered, certainly somewhat dusty, but not dirty. Leaning bookshelves stuffed with fat, leather-bound volumes took up two walls, while the bay windows in front held a curious sampling of items the store offered, set out in a confusing array that put off as many people as it attracted. There were treasures to be found, indeed, but not for the fastidious. Clutter swirled like autumn leaves around old chairs, dressers, sideboards, desks, rockers, wicker tables and an umbrella stand overflowing with rolled-up maps, knobby-ended walking sticks and an African shaman's staff.<br>Behind the cash area it was no tidier. A walnut-paneled door led to the storerooms, a washroom, and a tiny kitchen meant only for someone without a trace of claustrophobia in their mental make-up. There were more shelves on the walls, laden with everything from books and calendars stacked a foot high to more curious wonders. To one side, set up so that she could look out the front windows when she was thinking, was Sara's desk holding her typewriter, paper, ashtray, coffee mug, tottering piles of reference books, a stuffed brown bear called Mr. Tistle with a plaid patched stomach, a stack of <i>National Geographics</i> and a copper-and-brass pencil holder--all in a four-by-three-foot surface area.<br>That didn't include the pigeonholes at the back of the desk, stuffed with letters (answered and unanswered), envelopes, more paper, her driver's license (that she never remembered to take with her when she used the car), a small Aiwa cassette player, that was connected to a pair of Monitor Audio speakers balanced precariously on wrought iron brackets above the bay windows, and the filing system for her fledgling writing career that included notes (hundreds of them on anything from matchbook covers to the small sheets torn out of her spiralbound notebook), information on who had what story and how often it'd been rejected, a list of her accepted stories (eleven of them!), and the addresses for all her correspondents that had started out being in alphabetical order but somehow degenerated into catch-as-catch-can.<br>On the day that Sara found the pouch she'd been thinking of the storeroom and all those unopened boxes gathering dust. It was easier to think of them than to decide if she was writing a thriller, a Gothic, a fantasy, or some bizarre permutation of the three. The boxes came from rummage sales, estates, country auctions and Lord knew where. Her writing hadn't been going well that day so she decided to make a start on them.<br>Perched on a stool behind the counter, her typewriter covered with a piece of velvet with frayed edges and moth-holes to keep the dust from it, she was working on her third box. Like the first two it had decidedly more junk and dust in it than any sort of treasure. Sighing, she ignored the grime that coated her hands and entrenched itself under her fingernails and tried to make the best of it. She tapped her foot along with Silly Wizard, a Scots folk group that were playing on the cassette machine, her thoughts lost in daydreams.<br>While Sara was one of that exiguous segment of the world's population that views the commonplace through a screen of whimsy, she was not flighty. She could dream about the history of a particular knick-knack, creating in her mind all sorts of implausible origins for it at the same time as she decided on a price, neatly printed the amount on a small sticker, and attached it to the bottom of the item in question.<br>Rummaging through the box that day, she was, if not a candidate for the next cover of <i>Chatelaine</i>, at least a study of enterprise. Her thick brown curls fell past her shoulders with all the unruly orderliness of a hawthorn thicket. She was small and thin, with delicate bones and intensely green eyes, her features not so much classically beautiful as quirky. She was, as usual, dressed in a pair of faded jeans and a shapeless old sweater and a pair of practical brown leather shoes in desperate need of a polish.<br>"I've got to feel real," she would respond wearily to whichever well-intentioned friend was the latest to ask why she couldn't be a little more fashionable. "It's hard enough the way things are, without walking around like a mannequin."<br>"But..." the intrepid soul might start to argue.<br>"What I'd really like to be," Sara'd say then, "is a genuine tatterdemalion. You know--all patches and loose bits?"<br>Blowing the dust off the newest layer that the box had to offer, she certainly felt real, if not a complete ragamuffin. She'd just managed to put three finger-wide streaks of dirt on her cheek and breathed in a cloud of dust at the same time. Coughing, she dug out the latest treasure--a wind-up plastic bear that would have beaten its tiny drum if its drumsticks weren't broken off, its key lost, and--she rattled it speculatively--its innards not a jumble of loose bits. She considered throwing it out, glanced at Mr. Tistle, then found she didn't have the heart. She wrote 10$$$ on a sticker, stuck it on the bottom of its foot, and tried again. A brass ashtray joined the bear (75$$$), then a saucerless teacup (50$$$), a tin whisk (15$$$), and a postcard of the Chateau Laurier in a wooden frame ($2.50--because of the frame).<br>It must be time for lunch, she thought as she reached in again.<br>This time she came up with a parcel wrapped in brown paper. The Scotch tape that held the end flaps down were yellow and brittle with age. Pretending it was Christmas, or her birthday, she squeezed and shook it about a bit. Then, when she couldn't guess, she opened it.<br>Inside was a framed picture and a small leather bag that looked like it was made of tanned moosehide. Its drawstrings were tied in a knot. Well, this was nice, she thought, looking the bag over. She could use it as a changepurse, seeing how she'd lost her old one last night somewhere between leaving the st...</p><h2>Watching Over One Another in Love: A Wesleyan Model for Ministry Assessment</h2><p>Drawing on Wesleyan themes of grace and responsibility, Watching Over One Another In Love provides step-by-step guidance for creating a covenant-based ministry assessment process that holds persons accountable for fruit-bearing faith.

Memoir. Women's Studies. BLACKFISHING THE IUD is a daring and demanding memoir by author, Caren Beilin, about reproductive health and the IUD, gendered illness, medical gaslighting, and activism in the chronic illness community. Rhapsodic and unabashedly polemical, Beilin scrutinizes the literary, artistic, and medical history of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as she considers the copper IUD's role in triggering her sudden onset of chronic autoimmunity. As the title makes abundantly clear, the book is an argument that the copper IUD is sickening quite a lot of women--and that we listen first and foremost to women's testimony to begin to resolve it.<br><br>"BLACKFISHING THE IUD is a necessary and searing polemic. Deftly shifting between literary history and emerging scientific research, Caren Beilin defiantly insists on the truth of her own experience--and demands that medicine take the anecdotal reports of women like her seriously."--Maya Dusenbery<br><br>As I read I thought of alchemy, Beilin is an alchemist. She transmutes metal, in this case copper, into something that flames and sings and questions and fights. It's a supranatural work that quests after healing but also finds and makes sense in its paradoxes."--Johanna Hedva<br><br>"'Love does leave you open,' Caren Beilin proves in this heart-breaking, book-breaking work. Beilin opens her memoir of illness to the voices of others harmed by the IUD, a medical device that makes the writer's daily living and thinking into a story of autoimmune disease. Beilin and others who know the risks of being heard and treated as women include us in their generous acts of rage, empathy, gratitude, and information. Reading and writing are witchwork, transforming the isolation of suffering into a tender and common ground. This book reminds us that our bodies are sites of language we can trust and love and offer in forms more radical than we know."--Hilary Plum<br><br>"In BLACKFISHING THE IUD, Caren Beilin takes on a crucial topic heretofore only broached in online forums--the serious, ongoing health problems associated with the copper IUD--and explodes her investigation into a creative work like no other: rich with wide-ranging references but also retaining the urgency and intimacy of raw, personal forum posts. Dissatisfied with the non-answers offered by medicine, Beilin seeks to understand the harm done by the IUD through philosophy, literature, and daily life. By writing the IUD through literature, philosophy, bookselling, and birdwatching, she identifies it as a problem that reaches far beyond 'women's health' into society at large."--Amy Berkowitz</p><p>Caren Beilin is the author of BLACKFISHING THE IUD (Wolfman Books, 2019); SPAIN (Rescue Press, 2018); the novel, THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA (Noemi Press, 2014), which in its various forms, has been the recipient of a MacDowell Fellowship, a finalist in <em>Fence</em>'s Modern Prose Prize, and winner of Noemi Press's Book Award for Fiction; and a collection of short fictions, <em>Americans, Guests, or Us</em> (New Michigan Press, 2012).

Chloe is floored&#x2014;her family isn&#x2019;t Jewish, for one thing, and she doesn&#x2019;t know anything about tunnels or the history of the house. But as she begins to explore the dark and winding passageways beneath the chateau, nothing can prepare her for the shock of what she and Riley discover...<br> <br>With emotion and intrigue, Melanie Dobson brings World War II France to life in this beautiful novel about war, family, sacrifice, and the secrets of the past.</p><p><b>A Conversation with Melanie Dobson <br><br>1. How did you first come to know of the story of Vicomtesse Genevieve Marie Josephe de Saint Pern Menke on whom this story is loosely based? How do her children and grandchildren describe her? </b><br><br>After Genevieve passed away in 2010, her granddaughter shared Genevieve's stories of courage and faith with me. I was captivated by Genevieve's bravery in standing up against the Nazis when they could easily have killed her, and by the stories of hiding the French resistance underneath the family's ch�teau while the Germans occupied it. The Menke family partnered with me as I wrote this novel, and Ann Menke, Genevieve's daughter-in-law, graciously invited me to their family's manoir and former ch�teau in Normandy. Genevieve left a beautiful legacy as an elegant, courageous, feisty Norman woman who was strong in character and devout in her faith. Her husband, children, and grandchildren adored her, and I hope readers are inspired by her story as well.<br><b>2. Do you always visit the places where your books are set? Why is it helpful? What did you love most about your trip for this book? </b><br><br>I always visit the main setting of my books to discover what makes the place unique. The Internet is fantastic for accumulating general details about a location, but good sensory description--the local sights, smells, sounds--breathe life into a novel. And once I can see the setting in my mind's eye, I no longer get stuck on the details. My brain is freed to focus on the story. <br><br>I enjoyed everything about my trip to France--eating the crusty bread and local cheese, biking through the villages, staying in a medieval ch�teau with three dear friends. Also I loved spending time with Genevieve's family and visiting with new friends in Normandy who welcomed us into their homes.<br><b>3. This novel is steeped in the historic detail of World War II and the battle of Saint-L�. What was your research process like? </b><br><br>Before I started writing <i>Ch�teau of Secrets</i>, I read through a stack of resources about the war as well as a number of interviews with Jewish men who fought in the German army. To help me visualize the details, I obtained photographs of the battle of Saint-L� along with film footage of French men resisting the Germans. My time in Normandy was the most important step in the research process. I learned a tremendous amount by exploring the Utah Beach D-Day Museum, visiting Saint-L�, and drinking tea with men and women who shared their memories of the occupation and war.<br><b>4. Many of the main characters in this novel make great sacrifices for freedom, be it tangible or emotional. What does freedom mean to you? </b><br><br>Years ago a friend asked what I valued most in life, and my quick response was freedom. In hindsight, what I really meant was independence--the selfish freedom to do what I wanted, whenever I wanted. Much has happened since I answered that question, and the freedom I value now is more internal--freedom from anxiety and bitterness and fear. Instead of striving for things that deplete me or allowing my thoughts to whirl with anger and frustration, I try to focus on what God has called me to do and rely on Him for provision, direction, and peace. I don't always succeed at letting go, but this renewed faith in Christ has given me great freedom on the inside.<br><b>5. What would you describe as the main theme(s) in <i>Ch�teau of Secrets</i>? </b><br><br>The heart of this novel is about sacrifice--what happens to those willing to risk their life to rescue others and what happens to those who betray innocent people in an attempt to save themselves. Some of the characters lost their life in this story while others found healing in their later years. In the Book of John, Jesus said these beautiful words, "Love each other in the same way I have loved you. There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends." <br><br><b><br>6. What do you want readers to experience or take away from this novel? </b><br><br><i>Ch�teau of Secrets </i>is about seemingly ordinary people who stood against evil, often working in secret as they fought against the Nazis and protected innocent people marked for death. As I wrote this story, I was reminded that we have many opportunities today to stand against evil and protect those who are suffering. We may not be risking our life, but it is always extraordinary to sacrifice finances, time, and even our pride to help someone in need. <br><br><b><br>7. With which character do you relate the most? Why? </b><br><br>I'd like to say that I relate to Gis�le's heroic choices to rescue Adeline and other orphaned children, but since I've never been in her situation, I can't honestly say what I would do. I do identify deeply with the mixed emotions of many of the characters--Gis�le's faith and fear, Chloe's anger and relief, Michel's optimism in spite of the circumstances, the conflict in Josef's heart over his terrible dilemma, and both Lisette and Riley in their regrets and ultimately redemption. <br><b><br><br>8. Michel tells Gis�le "Courage doesn't mean you stop being afraid . . . It means you continue to fight when you're terrified" (page 298). How do you personally strive to live this out? </b><br><br>Fear is the personal dragon that I fight daily. Sometimes it's fear of failure or the unknown. Sometimes it's fear for my children or my husband. Sometimes it's ridiculous things that others might find amusing that keep me up at night. <br><br>Last year my family spent Christmas serving orphans in Uganda. I was afraid of countless things before and during that trip, but I knew we were supposed to go in spite of my fears and the experience changed our lives. God, in his faithfulness, continues to help me fight against this dragon, and I'm incredibly grateful that He never leaves nor forsakes us.<br><b>9. How does your degree and background in journalism influence your writing of fiction? </b><br><br>I pursued a career in journalism because I love to learn. Writing was and still is a fun outlet for me to dig deep as I research both historical events and contemporary people and places. I approach the writing of each new book as a journalist, delving into the time period and details of the events and location first. After a few weeks of research, my characters and plot begin to emerge from the factual accounts of the past.<br><b>10. A line from your website highlights your gift as a writer: "My issue is not about finding time to write. It's about finding time to live around my writing." With a passion for writing, what are the things that can stifle your creativity? What or who inspires and energizes you again? </b><br><br>Faux busyness stifles my creativity. Often when I'm on deadline, I'll lose myself to all sorts of seemingly urgent tasks like vacuuming the house or cleaning out the garage. In order to eliminate distraction, I like to escape to a coffee shop with a steady buzz of noise or a quiet hotel where I can immerse myself in my imaginary world. As a family, we also try to keep the Sabbath. After a day of rest, I'm rejuvenated and ready to write first thing Monday morning. <br>&nbsp;<br><br><b>12. When you are not writing, what do you do for fun? </b><br><br>I love exploring new places, hiking in the mountains, playing Settlers of Catan with friends, line dancing, working in my garden, taking yoga classes, reading novels with surprise endings, and most of all, laughing with my family while we dance, hike, or explore together. <br><b><br><br>13. What will you be working on next? </b><br><br>My next novel is called <i>Shadows of Ladenbrooke Manor,</i> and it's about a woman named Heather who returns to England to prepare her childhood home for sale. As she and her daughter work together, Heather discovers that her parents hid a terrible secret from her and their village when she was a girl. In spite of the risks to her heart and her future, Heather decides to pursue the truth about what happened in the beautiful gardens behind her family's cottage and in the gardens of the manor next door.Melanie Dobson is the award-winning author of fifteen historical romance, suspense, and contemporary novels.

Their gripping adventure begins in the ancient city of Jerusalem and takes them to the very spot in Galilee where Jesus taught the multitudes to pray. Along the way they discover a Hebrew version of the Lord&#39;s Prayer, preserved in secret by Jewish rabbis for over a thousand years. The richness of meaning that the Hebrew unlocks reveals a powerful message of spiritual growth for Jew and Christian alike. Join them on this provocative exploration of the Hebrew origins of the Lord&#39;s Prayer!</p><p><p>Nehemia Gordon holds a Masters Degree in Biblical Studies and a Bachelors Degree in Archaeology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Gordon has worked as a translator on the Dead Sea Scrolls and as a researcher deciphering ancient Hebrew manuscripts. He has been invited to speak in synagogues and churches around the world and has led groups of pilgrims and visitors on tours of biblical sites. A native of Chicago, Nehemia has made his home in Jerusalem, Israel since 1993.</p> <p>Keith Johnson earned his Masters of Divinity from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and has spent nearly two decades in Christian ministry. As an ordained Elder in the United Methodist Church, Johnson has served as pastor of Park Avenue Church in Minneapolis and as chaplain of the Minnesota Vikings. Johnson was also chosen as one of only 40 chaplains from around the world to serve the athletes of the 1996 Olympics Games in Atlanta. Keith lives in Charlotte, North Carolina with his wife and sons.</p>A Prayer to Our Father... represents a rare and uncommon collaboration between Nehemia Gordon, a Jew devoted to the ancient Hebrew faith, and Keith Johnson, a dedicated African American Christian believer and pastor. The book is as much about the remarkable relationship of these two men, and how they embarked on a common quest for the historical and Hebraic origins of the prayer, as it is about the understanding of the prayer itself... The book is written in an autobiographical style that pulls the reader into an engaging, unfolding story, that is every bit an adventure in learning and discovery. The most remarkable aspect of this story for me was to see how Johnson, as a devoted Christian seeking the Hebraic roots of Jesus (Yeshua), was drawn to study Hebrew with Gordon, and how Gordon in turn, without sharing Johnson's messianic views, could nonetheless wholeheartedly participate in the historical quest for the Hebraic roots of Jesus' most famous and well-known teaching the Lord's Prayer. This symbiotic relationship alone makes the book stand out as a unique and singular contribution that can be of great interest to both Christians and Jews. But what is just as remarkable are the results of the historical investigation itself. Johnson and Gordon take turns narrating their stories in a gripping first person style. Central to the book is an analysis of the Prayer as it appears in the various copies of Hebrew Matthew preserved by Ibn Shaprut, a 14th century Rabbi living in Spain. This is the text of Hebrew Matthew (called Even Bohen) that Professor George Howard brought to the attention of the academic world in 1987 (see my notes and summary). I agree with Howard, as do Gordon and Johnson, that this version of Matthew is not merely a translation of our Greek New Testament manuscripts, but represents an independent and ancient source written originally in Hebrew that was passed down in rabbinic circles for centuries. Hebrew Matthew offers us an opportunity to examine the prayer that Jesus taught his disciples in the original Hebrew, rather than an approximated version based on a translation from the Greek. The book is divided into two "terrains," one geographical and the other textual. Gordon and Johnson first examine all available evidence as to where Yeshua might have taught the prayer. They take the reader to all possible geographical locations, from Jerusalem to the Galilee, based on references in the New Testament and other early Christian sources. At each place they relate their own experiences and analysis of what appears to have been the most likely setting for the "mountain" scene depicted in Matthew 5 and Luke 6. They then turn to a line by line, phrase by phrase, analysis of the prayer in Hebrew, compared with the traditional English translations that are based on the Greek. There are surprises and insights at every turn, and frankly, I don't want to spoil the adventure for readers by revealing in this informal review much about the content. Let me just tantalize a bit here and say that no one reading this book, whether Jew, Christian, Muslim, or secularist, will ever be able to think of, much less pray, the AVINU (Hebrew for "Our Father") prayer in the same way again. One's understanding of the simple power and meaning of this prayer will be thoroughly enlightened and transformed. I am pleased to recommend this book to any and all who will take up the challenge to expand their horizons and experience the excitement of historical and textual investigations. You will not be disappointed. --Dr. James D. Tabor, Chair, Deptartment of Religious Studies, University of North Carolina, Charlotte<br><br><p>Gordon and Johnson provide a gentle walk through unfamiliar territory surrounding the Lord s Prayer. The territory is unfamiliar because they explore the Hebrew version of this well-known passage of Scripture. The walk is gentle because they have included their personal experiences as they traveled the land of Israel in search of the Hebraic roots of these verses. In a combination of travelogue, history and linguistic detective work, this book guides the reader to insights that only appear in the Hebrew original. It is a journey worth taking.</p> <p>Clearly written with the average reader in mind, A Prayer to Our Father does not overwhelm with etymological intricacies or theological arguments. Instead, it presents a journey of enlightenment, for the authors and for the reader, as it traverses the land of Israel, examining culture and history in an effort to peel back two thousand years of translation accumulation. The journey reaches its climax in an analysis of the Hebrew worldview connected to our Lord s simple prayer. The insights and corrections discovered in this recovery are formidable and immediately applicable. This is a valuable contribution to any believer s library.</p> --A. J. Moen, D. Phil., Academic Dean, Master s International Divinity School, Evansville, Indiana<br><br>I just finished the book and really enjoyed it. I teach liturgy at the Hebrew Union College so I know how important and difficult it is to teach and write about the topic. A Prayer to Our Father is a multi-layered love story: the love of prayer, the love of learning, the love of the land of Israel, the love of the Hebrew language, and the love of Judaism and Christianity. It is part detective story, part guide-book, part text-study and all love. It is also a fabulous model of chevruta (the interactive Jewish learning model) two people learning together, challenging each other and inspiring each other. Both Jews and Christians could learn a great deal from this book about their own and each others traditions. I highly recommend it! --Rabbi Levi Weiman-Kelman, Congregation Kol HaNeshama, Jerusalem</p><h2>A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government</h2><p><i>A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government </i>takes the form of a debate between a spokesman for Western ideals of democracy and progress, and an advocate for adherence to traditional samurai values. Their discussion is moderated by the imperturbable Master Nankai, who loves nothing more than to drink and argue politics. The fiction of the drinking bout allowed Chomin to debate freely topical political issues, in a discussion that offers an astute analysis of contemporary European politics and a prophetic vision of Japan's direction. This lucid and precise translation of a delightful work has been designated one of the UNESCO series of classics of world literature.</p><p>Nakae Chomin was one of Japan's seminal thinkers during the Meiji era (1868&#x2013;1912), a time when the nation was attempting to leapfrog from feudalism into the modern world. The son of a low-ranking samurai family, Chomin (a pen name meaning "the masses") began his studies with the Chinese and Buddhist classics, later traveling to France where he studied political philosophy. After returning home he won a seat in Japan's first parliament, although he quickly resigned for reasons of conscience. Chomin's critical writings continually drew the ire of the government; he was often censured and at one point was sent into exile in Osaka. He nevertheless continued to write prolifically, despite poverty and illness, until his death in 1901.Text: English, Japanese (translation)</p><h2>Ainslie&#39;s Complete Guide to Thoroughbred Racing</h2><p>Covers recent technological changes and the basics of breeding, conformation, calculating speed and pace, the factors of condition, class, and weight, rating jockeys, stables, and tracks, tote-board tips, and sixty tips for profitable betting</p><p></p><h2>St. Andrews Sojourn: St. Andrews Sojourn</h2><p>The Old Course at St. Andrews is the great hallowed ground of golf, and it was there that George Peper was playing in 1983 when he hit a slice so hideous that he never found the ball.

He lives in St. Andrews, Scotland.<b><p>Chapter One: The Slice of My Life</p><p></p></b><p></p><p>It was a ghastly, careening push-slice -- the mongrel of all golf shots -- that changed the course of my life. Okay, maybe that's a bit breathless, but there's no question that the banana ball I perpetrated on July 16, 1983, was the finest shot I've ever missed.</p><p></p><p>The scene was the 18th tee of the most famous golf course in the world, the Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland. As the editor-in-chief of <i>Golf Magazine,</i> I'd been invited, along with half a dozen or so colleagues from other American golf publications and newspapers, on a pre-British Open boondoggle, courtesy of a man named Frank Sheridan.</p><p></p><p>Sheridan had purchased the Old Course Hotel, the modern five-story monster that looms inharmoniously over the penultimate hole of the ancient links, the balconies of its sixty deluxe rooms jutting impudently outward from a chunky stucco frame. When the hotel first opened, back in 1968, Henry Longhurst aptly described it as "a dresser with its drawers pulled out," and despite its advantageous location, the place had never really caught on.</p><p></p><p>Sheridan, however, was determined to transform the hotel (which he'd rechristened the Old Course Golf &amp; Country Club) into Scotland's premier hostelry, and to help make his point he'd drafted Jack Nicklaus and Seve Ballesteros to launch a weekend-long celebration with a head-to-head match on the Old Course, to be reported upon by us conscripted scribes.</p><p></p><p>But at the eleventh hour, there arose what the Scots refer to as a wee glitch. Commandeering a tee time on the Old Course is not a simple matter, even if your names are Nicklaus and Ballesteros. The St. Andrews Links Trust -- which controls play on all six of the town's courses -- had ruled that Sheridan's circus would not come to town -- it would create too much disruption to the regular Saturday morning play. And so, rather hastily, the battle of the titans had been relegated to Ladybank, a comparatively unknown parkland course in a nearby town of the same name.</p><p></p><p>"It's just down the road -- you'll see the sign," said the hotel porter on the appointed morning as I headed out the door to my rental car along with <i>Golf Digest's</i> Ross Goodner, Ron Coffman of <i>Golf World,</i> and Furman Bisher, the venerable and feisty sports columnist for the <i>Atlanta Constitution.</i></p><p></p><p>Down the road Ladybank was, but a bit farther down the road than we'd expected. We'd driven roughly ten miles, all four of us craning our necks at every little sign, placard, and poster, when Bisher boomed from the back seat, "Aw hell, why don't we just forget about it and go play some golf."</p><p></p><p>It was an offer none of us could refuse. And so, approximately 300 yards short of the intersection I now know to be signposted "Ladybank," I U-turned my Vauxhall Viva and headed back to St. Andrews.</p><p></p><p>Up to the first tee of the Old Course we marched and lo and behold there was an open slot. Today this would never happen, and even back in July of 1983 it was relatively astounding. What was even more remarkable, however, was that upon learning of our good fortune, all four underpaid and overprivileged members of the golf media immediately reached into our pockets and not only paid to play but sprung for caddies. (My colleagues, I assumed, had the same intention I had -- to do some creative writing at expense account time.)</p><p></p><p>Four blissful hours later, we were tramping back into the lobby of the hotel, bags over our shoulders, when suddenly we found ourselves the focus of some highly unwanted attention. There, in the center of the lobby, standing in a semicircle and looking directly at us, were Nicklaus, Ballesteros, and Sheridan, in the middle of a press conference with our invited colleagues, including the BBC, with its klieg lights glaring and cameras rolling. Absolutely horror-struck, I moved into "perp walk" mode, shoulders hunched, head bowed, hand shading brow.</p><p></p><p>Old Furman had no such compunctions. Striding straight up to Nicklaus, he said, "Jack, we're awfully sorry we didn't come to watch you boys down at Ladybank, but you see, we were able to get a tee time on the Old Course!"</p><p></p><p>It was during that illicit round that I hit the fateful slice of my life. Understand now, the home hole at the Home of Golf lies seamlessly side by side with the opening hole, comprising a target the approximate breadth and contour of Nebraska. But as any devout golfer knows, the Old Course is not just a golf course, it's a shrine -- golf's version of the Vatican -- and number 18 is its culmination, its Sistine Chapel, the last place you want to demonstrate a proclivity to stray.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, running along the entire right edge of the hole is a sturdy, gleaming white fence, marking out of bounds, and just beyond that fence, across a narrow street, is a row of stately slate-roofed townhouses, their bulging bay-windowed facades adding considerably to the intimidation of the final tee shot. Yes, when a golfer puts his peg in the ground at number 18 on the Old, every fiber in his being tells him "Don't go right."</p><p></p><p>Which of course I did, with a swing so convulsive that, from the moment the ball left the clubface all four players and all four caddies knew it was gone, destined for not grass but glass -- or steel or granite or human flesh or some calamitous combination of them all.</p><p></p><p>Curiously, however, it just disappeared, diving without bounce or clank into the nether regions of the gray stone neighborhood. I never found that ball. But while searching for it I did find something else -- a For Sale sign. Incredibly, the bottom two floors of one of those townhouses -- 2,000 square feet of private residence -- was on the market, and fate had drawn me (actually sliced me) to it.</p><p></p><p>On Monday morning, instead of heading down to Birkdale with my cohorts, I phoned the listing broker and asked the price. When I heard it, my heart skipped a beat -- �45,000, or about $65,000 at the then prevailing exchange rate. The previous owner, an elderly woman, had died earlier that year and left everything in the hands of lawyers and accountants who had been instructed to accept the first offer to hit the asking price. In six weeks, no such offer had been received.</p><p></p><p>I took a quick walk through the place and that evening called home for permission. My wife, although a confirmed nongolfer, had been to St. Andrews and I knew she liked the town.</p><p></p><p>"The interior's not in great shape," I said, "but that's okay -- the layout is ideal, the rooms are big, the ceilings are high, and there are four working fireplaces. Besides, we're never going to actually live here -- it's an investment. We can rent it to students to help with the carrying costs, and in the summers it'll be free if we want to visit. I know it's a chunk out of our savings, honey, but wait until you see the view."</p><p></p><p>Happily, she didn't need much selling. And so, two months later in a solicitor's office in Dundee, George and Libby Peper became the proud owners of 9A Gibson Place, St. Andrews, Fife.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Copyright � 2006 by George Peper</p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>The Healthy Brain Toolbox: Neurologist-Proven Strategies to Prevent Memory Loss and Protect Your Aging Brain</h2><p>At last, neurologist-proven strategies to improve your memory and protect yourself against age-related diseases of the brain!

Beginning with the precolonial land-use practice of Native Americans and concluding with our twenty-first century concerns over our global ecological crisis, <i>American Environmental History</i> addresses contentious issues such as the preservation of the wilderness, the expulsion of native peoples from national parks, and population growth, and considers the formative forces of gender, race, and class. Entries address a range of topics, from the impact of rice cultivation, slavery, and the growth of the automobile suburb to the effects of the Russian sea otter trade, Columbia River salmon fisheries, the environmental justice movement, and globalization. This illustrated reference is an essential companion for students interested in the ongoing transformation of the American landscape and the conflicts over its resources and conservation. It makes rich use of the tools and resources (climatic and geological data, court records, archaeological digs, and the writings of naturalists) that environmental historians rely on to conduct their research. The volume also includes a compendium of significant people, concepts, events, agencies, and legislation, and an extensive bibliography of critical films, books, and Web sites.</p><p>Carolyn Merchant is the Chancellor's Professor of Environmental History, Philosophy, and Ethics at the University of California, Berkeley.

In it Smith analyzes the major elements of political economy, from market pricing and the division of labor to monetary, tax, trade, and other government policies that affect economic behavior. Throughout he offers seminal arguments for free trade, free markets, and limited government.</p> <p>Criticizing mercantilists who sought to use the state to increase their nations' supply of precious metals, Smith points out that a nation's wealth should be measured by the well-being of its people. Prosperity in turn requires voluntary exchange of goods in a peaceful, well-ordered market. How to establish and maintain such markets? For Smith the answer lay in man's social instincts, which government may encourage by upholding social standards of decency, honesty, and virtue, but which government undermines when it unduly interferes with the intrinsically private functions of production and exchange. Social and economic order arise from the natural desires to better one's (and one's family's) lot and to gain the praise and avoid the censure of one's neighbors and business associates. Individuals behave decently and honestly because it gives them a clear conscience as well as the good reputation necessary for public approbation and sustained, profitable business relations.</p></p><p>Adam Smith&#39;s masterpiece, first published in 1776, is the foundation of modern economic thought and remains the single most important account of the rise of, and the principles behind, modern capitalism. Written in clear and incisive prose, The Wealth of Nations articulates the concepts indispensable to an understanding of contemporary society; and Robert Reich&#39;s new Introduction for this edition both clarifies Smith&#39;s analyses and illuminates his overall relevance to the world in which we live. As Reich writes, &#34;Smith&#39;s mind ranged over issues as fresh and topical today as they were in the late eighteenth century--jobs, wages, politics, government, trade, education, business, and ethics.&#34;"Adam Smith's enormous authority resides, in the end, in the same property that we discover in Marx: not in any ideology, but in an effort to see to the bottom of things."<br>--Robert L.

The British Empire, he argues, was much more than a group of colonies ruled over by a scattering of British expatriates until eventual independence. It was, above all, a global phenomenon. Its power derived rather less from the assertion of imperial authority than from the fusing together of three different kinds of empire: the settler empire of the &#39;white dominions&#39;; the commercial empire of the City of London; and &#39;Greater India&#39; which contributed markets, manpower and military muscle. This unprecedented history charts how this intricate imperial web was first strengthened, then weakened and finally severed on the rollercoaster of global economic, political and geostrategic upheaval on which it rode from beginning to end.</p><p>A magisterial global history of the rise and fall of the British Empire during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

For each author the editors provide a biographical sketch, a brief discussion of how his or her selections relate to a larger body of work, and a selected bibliography. In addition, this new volume includes a larger sampling of women writers.</p><p>Maureen O&#x2019;Rourke Murphy is dean of students and associate professor of English at Hofstra University, past president of the American Committee for Irish Studies (ACIS) and author of A Guide to Irish Studies in the United States.<br><br>James MacKillop is also a past president of ACIS and the author of The Dictionary of Celtic Mythology, Fionn mac Cumhaill: Celtic Myth in English Literature, and editor of Contemporary Irish Cinema: From &#x201c;The Quiet Man&#x201d;<br>to &#x201c;Dancing at Lughnasa,&#x201d; the last two volumes also published by Syracuse University Press.A splendid selection of the best of Irish and Anglo-Irish literature from the eighth century to the present.

Peter Balin, the painter of the Xultun Tarot deck, has written a book about the tarot and the Maya Indians&#39; view of the world. This is a very relevant book that deals with the problems of our times. Although the approach is new and deals with American knowledge, it will serve all Tarot decks regardless of their origin. The reader journeys with the Fool towards the impeccability of the sorcerer, with each step along the way clearly defined. The graphics alone are so spellbinding that even if you are not interested in the Mayas or the tarot, there is something in this book for you.</p><p></p><h2>The Power Of Covenant Prayer (Christian Living)</h2><p>What is the difference between prayer and covenant prayer? A covenant with God takes you further into your goal of Christlikeness. When you make this commitment to consistently communicate with the Father above in prayer, you will begin to see the power of God&#x2019;s grace actively at work in your life and in the lives of those around you. Through this awesome power of covenant prayer, God creates within you a life that He can use extraordinarily in the process of divine redemption. It&#x2019;s time for you to make this covenant with God as you mature from being simply a believer in prayer to becoming a living sacrifice full of the power of covenant prayer. <br></p><p><p> <b>Francis Frangipane</b> is founding pastor of River of Life Ministries in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which he began in 1989.

As he looks into what seems to be a simple, tragic accident, the ante is raised when more people start to die or disappear, and Amos uncovers a world of treachery and hurt that shakes a large L.A. Jewish community to its core.</p><p>Andy Weinberger is a longtime bookseller who opened Readers&#39; Books in Sonoma, California, with his wife, Lilla Weinberger, in 1991. Born in New York, he grew up in the Los Angeles area and studied poetry and Chinese history at the University of New Mexico. He lives in Sonoma, where Readers&#39; Books continues to thrive. This is his first novel.&#x201c;Andy Weinberger has done something extraordinary with his first novel: he&#x2019;s written a truly great detective novel that is fresh and original, but already feels like it&#x2019;s a classic. In the tradition of Walter Mosley, Raymond Chandler, and Sue Grafton, semi-retired private eye Amos Parisman roams LA&#x2019;s seedy and not-so-seedy neighborhoods in pursuit of justice.

Not only does Weinberger (and his aging, retired detective Amos Parisman) have a great sense of humor, but his take on Los Angeles makes this a joy to read for all of us locals. Amos has long since retired but is called back into the action by the board of directors of his local temple to investigate the death of their rabbi, who died during lunch at the iconic Canter&#x2019;s Deli. Amos takes us on a ride through Los Angeles via his lifetime of experience thinking through the mysteries of life and death, while mentoring his sidekick (and ex-professional wrestler) Omar Villasenor.

Full of imaginative stuff to do and make, <i>Curious Jane</i> offers plenty of spectacular projects and DIY fun. From fantastic crafts to inspirational ideas for budding designers and inventors, this smart, colorful, and idea-packed book has the perfect project for every cool, creative young girl!</p><p>Curious Jane was founded six years ago by&nbsp;Samantha&nbsp;Razook Murphy&nbsp;to give her daughters, and all young girls, a place to be creative and to tinker and experiment in a fun, high-energy environment.&nbsp;Their classes revolve around science, design, and engineering and empower girls through hands-on, open-ended, project-based work. They run&nbsp;summer camps,&nbsp;after-school programs, birthday parties,&nbsp;and events, and have a quarterly&nbsp;magazine&nbsp;for cool, creative girls, ages 6 to 11. In 2014, they won&nbsp;a prestigious Small Business Grant from Chase in support of their programs for girls.Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;The concept behind this volume started with a summer camp in Brooklyn that was organized by Samantha Razook Murphy to encourage her daughters to "tinker, create, invent, and have fun!" The result is a well-organized, easy-to-follow, and heavily illustrated assortment of activities and craft ideas that can be done using readily available and generally affordable materials. Some activities are intended just for fun or to help kids build friendship through science. One such exercise is the "toss and talk ball," in which topics are written out on an inflatable ball meant to be tossed to others, who then answer the question closest to their right thumb. Others come with a brief but lucid explanation of the science involved. For instance, the directions for creating "fizzy bath bombs" are accompanied by information on why the bath bombs react when they are placed in the bathtub. Adult involvement is suggested when needed. Though aimed at girls, this title will also engage those who do not identify as female. VERDICT This attractive offering will be most useful as a supplement to other science and craft materials. Consider for large collections or established maker spaces.&#x2014;Maria B.

Afflicted with a rare disease that will be fatal unless he quits smoking, Hugo retreats to his once aristocratic family&#x2019;s dilapidated mansion, determined to smoke himself to death without forfeiting any of his pleasures. To his chagrin, the world that he has forsaken is not quite finished with him. First, his sanctimonious older brother moves in, closely followed by his estranged wife, their alleged daughter, and his gay uncle. Infuriated at the violation of his sanctum, Hugo devises hilariously perverse ploys to send the intruders packing. Yet the unexpected consequences of his schemes keep forcing him to reconsider, however fleetingly, the more wholesome ingredients of love, and life itself.</p><p>For ten years, Hugo Whittier, upper-class scion, former gigolo, failed belle-lettrist has been living a hermit&#x2019;s existence at Waverly, his family's crumbling mansion overlooking the Hudson. He passes the time reading Montaigne and M.F.K. Fisher, cooking himself delicious meals, smoking an endless number of cigarettes, and nursing a grudge against the world. But his older brother, Dennis, has returned, in retreat from an unhappy marriage, and so has his estranged wife, Sonia, and their (she claims) daughter, Bellatrix, shattering Hugo's cherished solitude. He's also been told by a doctor that he has the rare Buerger's disease, which means that unless he stops smoking he will die--all the more reason for Hugo to light up, because his quarrel with life is bitter and an early death is a most attractive prospect. <br><br>As Hugo smokes and cooks and sexually schemes and pokes his perverse nose into other people&#x2019;s marriages and business, he records these events as well as his mordant, funny, gorgeously articulated personal history and his thoughts on life and mortality in a series of notebooks. His is one of the most perversely compelling literary personalities to inhabit a novel since John Lanchester&#x2019;s <i>The Debt to Pleasure</i>, and his ancestors include the divinely cracked and eloquent narrators of the works of Nabokov. As snobbish and dislikable as Hugo is, his worldview is so enticingly conveyed that even the most resistant reader will be put under his spell. His insinuating voice gets into your head and under your skin in the most seductive way. And as he prepares what may be his final Christmas feast for family and friends, readers will have to ask, &#x201c;Is this the end of Hugo?&#x201d;<br><br><i>The Epicure&#x2019;s Lament</i> is a wry and witty novel about love and death and family, a major contribution to a vein of literature that the author Kate Christensen has dubbed &#x201c;loser lit.&#x201d; It more than fulfills the bright promise of her lavishly praised previous two novels, and gives us an antihero for our time--hard to like, impossible to resist.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i><p>&#x201c;What a wonderfully monstrous voice Kate Christensen has created in Hugo Whittier, trust-fund misanthrope, chain-smoking foodie, confirmed cad.

A teacher and monk, he was consecrated bishop (ca. 660-680), but preferred to live out his live as an anchorite. A Scriptural scholar, he studies Scripture so much that he became blind and had to dictate his writings. He died at an advance age and was buried in Rabban Shabur, where he spent most of his monastic life. St Isaac&#39;s monastic anthropology has a major influence on all of Byzantine spiritual literature. The way toward God, in his writing, was threefold: the way of the body, the way of the soul, and the way of the spirit. In the first stage, the person begins with a total preoccupation with the passions and moves toward God by means of bodily works: fasting, vigils, and psalmody. The next stage involves a struggle against thoughts foreign to the nature of the soul, turning from created objects to the contemplation of God&#39;s wisdom and a transformation within. As the person arrives at a total openness of the soul to the future hope, he proceeds to the final stage of unified knowledge, which is an attitude of wonder and praise in continual prayer to God, leading to the freedom of immortal life that is given after the resurrection.This translation, by Mary Hansbury, of St Isaac of Nineveh&#39;s work On the Ascetical Life is based on the Syriac text edited by P. Bedjan in Mar Isaacus Ninivita, De Perfectione Religiosa.

This powerful book describes authentic tantra, what distinguishes tantra from other spiritual paths, and how the tantric way combines hatha yoga, meditation, visualization, ayurveda, and other disciplines. In this gripping exposition, Pandit Tigunait will take you back to ancient times by sharing his experiences with tantric masters and the techniques they taught him.</p><p>Pandit Rajmani Tigunait, Ph.D., is the Spiritual Director of the Himalayan Institute. He received his doctorate in Sanskrit from the University of Allahabad in India, and a doctorate of Philosophy from the University of Pennsylvania. A disciple of Sri Swami Rama and lifelong practitioner of yoga and meditation, Pandit Tigunait is the author of many books and numerous articles, and has given lectures throughout the world.From Chapter 1:<br> According to most spiritual traditions the desire for wordly pleasures is incompatible with the spiritual quest. You can have the treasures of this world, they say, or the treasures of the spiritual realm, but not both. This either/or approach sets off and endless internal struggle in those who are drawn to spiritual beliefs and practices but who have at the same time a natural urge to fulfill their worldly desires. This includes most of us. And when there is no way to reconcile these two impulses we fall prey to guilt and self-condemnation, or we repress either our spiritual desires or our worldly desires, or we try to have both, and become hypocrites. <p> The tantric approach to life avoids this painful and confusing dilemma by taking the whole person into account- our human as well as our spiritual nature. The literal meaning of tantra is "to weave, to expand, to spread," and according to tantric adepts, we can achieve true and everlasting fulfillment only when all the threads of the fabric of life are woven according to the pattern designated by nature. When we are born, ignorance, desire, attachment, fear, and false images of ourselves and others tangle and tear the threads. </p><p> Tantra sadhana (practice) reweaves the fabric of life and restores it to its original pattern. No other path of yoga is as systematic or as comprehensive. The profound practices of hath yoga, pranayama, mudras, rituals, kundalini yoga, nada yoga, mantra, yantra, mandala, visualization of deities, alchemy, ayurveda, astrology, and hundreds of esoteric techniques for engendering wordly and spiritual prosperity blend perfectly within the tantric disciplines.</p></p><h2>The Snake Fight (Battle Bugs #8) (8)</h2><p>Ancient warriors!<br><br>The Battle Bugs have discovered a tunnel that leads directly from Reptile Island to Bug Island.

At the same time, Hornbacher reveals how the Twelve Steps can offer insights, spiritual sustenance, and practical guidance to enhance stability for those who truly have to approach sanity and sobriety one day at a time.</p><p>In addition to her international best-seller <i>Madness: A Bipolar Life,</i> Marya Hornbacher is the author of <i>Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia</i> and a novel, <i>The Center of Winter</i>.<p><b>The Twelve Steps and Mental Illness</b></p> <p><b>by</b></p> <p><b>Marya Hornbacher</b></p><b></b> <p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Step One</b></p> <p>I don't know which was the stranger, more terrifying moment: the moment when a psychiatrist told me I had a mental illness, or the moment I realized I was an alcoholic, through and through. I remember both moments clearly: my stomach dropped, the room seemed suddenly cold, and I wanted to run for the door. When it came time for me to face facts, I didn't do it. Not that first time. The fear that accompanied those simple facts&#x2014;that I have a mental illness, that I am an alcoholic&#x2014;was so overwhelming that I did what fear told me to do: I hid.</p> <p>Addicts are good at hiding&#x2014;for a while. We've turned it into an art form. We hide from our families, our friends, our employers; some of us feel we are hiding from God. We are capable of believing the ridiculous notion that no one can see what's really going on. No one really knows how sad and sick and dependent we are. People with mental illness often share this skill at hiding. The world we live in tells us that mental illness is something to be ashamed of, and heaven knows we feel that shame&#x2014;and we do all we can to hide our illness from that judging world, from our fellows, and often from ourselves. </p> <p>So by the time the mentally ill addict or alcoholic has reached a place of complete defeat&#x2014;by the time we realize that <i>our lives have become unmanageable&#x2014;</i>we are living under so many layers of shame, deception, denial, and fear, that it seems at first impossible to dig ourselves out. We are used to the dark, lonely place where we've lived for so long. We're used to the company of our substance of choice, the comfort of our habitual terror, the pain of our mental illness. These things are more familiar than what the twelve steps promise: a life in a community of people like ourselves, but who have found a better way to live. To the practicing addict with mental illness, a life up there in the light seems almost as frightening as a life down here in our own private hell.</p> <p>But we must reach for that life if we want to survive. </p> <p>Addicts, mentally ill or not, must all come to a turning point where they recognize that there is no future ahead on the road they're walking, and realize that it's time for them to turn down a new road. That moment of realization is rarely a calm one. It often takes hitting the wall pretty hard&#x2014;often more than once&#x2014;before we see the futility of trying to live the way we were. From the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions: 'We perceive that only through utter defeat are we able to take our first steps toward liberation and strength.'</p> <p>And that is where we're headed, when we set out with Step One: toward liberation and strength. It's a paradox that we triumph through surrender; but it is true. It is true of addiction, and it is true of mental illness: the way <i>out</i> is <i>through. </i></p> <p>When I first came into the program, I found the idea of admitting defeat insane. I already <i>felt </i>defeated, by my illness, by my addiction, by my entire life. Why were these people asking me to go one step further and admit <i>complete </i>defeat&#x2014;admit, in short, that I was wholly and completely powerless? I insisted that I would get sober anyway, whether I admitted powerlessness or not. Couldn't I just hang onto <i>some </i>sense of control over my life? I told my sponsor she didn't understand mental illness&#x2014;if she understood the horrible feeling of being literally out of control of your own mind, she would never try to make me feel even less power than I already did. </p> <p>I believed, at first, that Step One would be impossible for me. I believed my mental illness would make it too painful. I believed it would be too excruciating, too terrifying, to admit total powerlessness over my addiction and over my life, when I already felt so terribly helpless as it was. </p> <p>But I have come to see this differently. I have come to see the first step as one that my metal illness allows me to understand with particular clarity. I began to apply what I know about mental illness to what I was learning about addiction; and I began to listen to what I was being told about how addiction could be overcome.</p> <p>Who knows better than we do a true sense of helplessness over the body and mind? Our mental illnesses do not define us, but they are part of the very bodies we live in and part of the very makeup of our minds. My mental illness is inscribed on my genes and expressed in my very thoughts&#x2014;it's that close to me. Working the twelve steps, I began to learn that addiction is an illness of body and mind as well. It is an allergy of the body that manifests itself as an obsession of the mind. It is passed through families in the genes, just as mental illness is. People who suffer from addiction are physically different from people who do not; our bodies respond to certain substances and behaviors differently than do healthy, non-addicted bodies. </p> <p>All these things are true of the body of someone with mental illness: it too is a physical disease that manifests as a disorder of mind. The brain is a complicated organ, and we are only just beginning to understand it. But one thing is clear: many people who deal with mental illness also deal with addiction. And while that can at times seem like kind of a bum deal, it also offers those of us who have mental illness <i>and </i>addiction some wonderful opportunities.</p> <p>The twelve steps, it is often said, are a program for living. They are not just a way of keeping the plug in the jug. And the first step&#x2014;admitting we are powerless, and that our lives are out of control&#x2014;is how we make a beginning on that new way of living. </p> <p>It's important to remember that the first step isn't taken for its own sake&#x2014;we aren't admitting powerlessness as an end in itself. The first step is not there just to make us feel terrified and out of control. It's there to get us started on our way through the rest of the steps, to get us started on this journey to a new life. It's there to help us let go of our vise-grip on the delusions that keep us sick. Picture Step One as the moment when you open your hands and let all the deceptions, denial, shame, and fear drop to the ground. Then walk away.</p> <p>The same things that keep us trapped in active addictions prevent us from dealing in a healthy way with our mental illness. We tell ourselves: it isn't that bad. No one can tell. It isn't hurting anyone but me. Everyone's making a big deal out of nothing. Or we tell ourselves: it's hopeless. No one can help me. There's no point in trying. I'm going to die this way, and there's no way out. Or, we tell ourselves: If I just ignore it, it will go away. If I just pretend this isn't happening, maybe it will stop. </p> <p>These are delusions, and they are fatal. Until we honestly face our mental illness, and do all we can to treat and manage it, we will continue to be limited and harmed by it; until we honestly face our addiction, and do all we can to recover from it, we will continue to live in this hell of isolation, smashed dreams, hopelessness, and despair. We cannot choose one or the other&#x2014;we can't say, I will deal with my mental illness but continue in my addiction; and we can't say, I will sober up but continue to ignore my mental illness. To try to choose is foolish. They must both be dealt with&#x2014;dealt with head-on, and at once.</p> <p>The first time I went to a twelve-step meeting, I was badly hung over and several days off the medications I needed. I remember sitting in the meeting room, staring at the signs with the Twelve Steps that hung on the wall. It was blindingly sunny, I felt like the floor was swimming, and I was peering at the words. I could not make head or tail of what they said. I mean, I could read them&#x2014;I just couldn't make sense of what they meant. I read through them several times, and finally gave up and just focused on the first step. </p> <p><i>Admitted we were powerless over alcohol&#x2014;</i>well, I wasn't so sure about that. Sure, I drank a lot. Too much. I knew that. But <i>powerless? </i>It seemed like an awfully strong word.</p> <p><i>...and that our lives had become unmanageable. </i>Now, <i>that </i>I could get behind. No <i>question </i>was my life unmanageable. My life was a raging mess. Everyone I knew had a theory about why it was such a mess&#x2014;I drank too much, I needed more therapy, I worked too hard, I didn't sleep enough, I kept going off my meds. And I had a theory, too: I was just a screw-up, had always been a screw-up, and would always be a screw-up, no matter what I did. </p> <p>So, sitting in that meeting room, I couldn't quite explain why I was hit with the realization that those steps on the wall were a lifeboat, and I was sinking, and I needed to hang on for dear life. </p> <p>You know what? I didn't. I walked out of the meeting and went home and took my meds with a beer. I did what I always did&#x2014;I hid. </p> <p>My life wasn't really unmanageable, I decided. And I <i>certainly </i>wasn't powerless over alcohol.</p> <p>Fast-forward just a few months: I'm sitting in a snowbank on the sidewalk of a wide, dirty, empty street. It's maybe 7 o'clock in the morning. The sun's just coming up, and I'm out of booze. I'm peering into the mouth of the bottle, as if I'll find some more in there if I look real hard. I'm trying to stand up, but am too drunk to get out of the snowbank. Freezing cold, wet and filthy, I realize the liquor store won't open for another three hours. I start to cry.</p> <p>I am powerless over alcohol. And my life has become seriously unmanageable. </p> <p>Complete defeat. </p> <p>In other words: a new beginning.</p> <p>Every addict wants the magic bullet, the moment of revelation where we said, 'Aha!' and it all came clear. Sadly, few of us have such a moment. My snowbank realization that I was pretty well done for if I didn't get some help was followed by months and months of fighting. Fighting other people, fighting the program, fighting myself. Fighting, first and foremost...</p></p><h2>Uranus and the Bubbles of Trouble (11) (Heroes in Training)</h2><p>A clash between the Titans and The Olympians at sea leaves Zeus and his friends shipwrecked&#x2014;and in a tidal wave of trouble&#x2014;in this Heroes in Training adventure.<br><br>After an encounter with Uranus, God of the Sky (and father of the Titans), the Olympians find themselves in the middle of a battle between two big-time Titans.

The sky above them had started to turn as black as night&#x2014;in the middle of the day! Obviously, this was no ordinary darkness.<br> <br>&#x201c;Guys, this doesn&#x2019;t look good,&#x201d; he said. The others&#x2014;all kids Zeus&#x2019;s own age&#x2014;nodded gravely.

Onshore nearby were also Apollo and his twin sister, Artemis. With Athena, Ares, and the newest member, Hephaestus, that made eleven Olympians in all.<br> <br>Black-haired, blue-eyed Zeus was the leader of the group. Though he and the others looked like normal mortal boys and girls, they were actually immortals and their actions were mighty.

This was an outcome every citizen in Greece lived in fear of!<br> <br>What the sudden strange sky had to do with Cronus, Zeus wasn&#x2019;t sure. But he guessed there must be some connection.

This book pulls back the veil into the unseen world, where there is a battle. This book will quickly become a classic.

In this notorious&nbsp;chronicle of that time, he records unforgettable accounts of the Stones' perilous misadventures racing cars along the Cote d'Azur, murder at Altamont, nights with the Beatles at the Stones-owned nightclub Vesuvio, frantic flights to Switzerland for blood changes, and the steady stream of women, including Anita Pallenberg, Marianne Faithfull, and Bianca Jagger. Here are the Stones at their debauched peak cavorting around the world, smashing Bentleys, working black magic, getting raided, snorting coke, and mainlining heroin.

Through the prayers in the Bible we look into the profoundest issues of life and death, and the deepest longings of our own hearts. And we learn about the God to whom we pray, the one who wants to talk with us, the one who takes the initiative in our relationship with him. In this classic book on prayer, John White helps us listen to Abraham plead for Sodom and Gomorrah. We watch Jacob wrestle with the Angel of the Lord. We hear David confess his sin. We also see him dance before the ark of the covenant. We hear Hannah ask for a child. Finally, John White shows how Jesus&#39; prayers on the cross present a model for facing our last hours as well. The ten prayers in this book will take you near to the holy one of the universe, the personal God of each person in the world.</p><p>John White was born in Liverpool, England, on March 5, 1924, and grew up in Manchester.

Composing herself, smoothing her hair, she mounted the steps.<br>As she put her parasol in the porcelain holder in the little vestibule, she heard her stepfather bellowing at her sister.<br>"I'll not have language like that in my house. You may think that because you call yourself a doctor you have a right to indecent behavior, but not in my house," Duncan Gates shouted.<br>Blair Chandler, as like her twin sister as another person can be, glared at the man, who was a few inches shorter than she was and built as solidly as a stone building. "Since when is this your house? My father -- ."<br>Houston stepped into the family parlor and put herself between her sister and her stepfather. "Isn't it time for dinner? Perhaps we should go in." With her back to her stepfather, she gave a pleading look to her sister.<br>Blair turned away from them both, her anger obvious.<br>Duncan took Houston's arm and led her past the staircase and toward the dining room. "At least I have one decent daughter."<br>Houston winced as she heard the often repeated remark. She hated being compared to Blair, and worse, hated being the winner.<br>They were barely seated at the big, mahogany table, each setting laid with crystal, porcelain and sterling, Duncan at the head, Opal Gates at the foot, the twins across from each other, when he started again.<br>"You'd think you'd want to do something to please your mother," Duncan said, glaring at Blair, as an eleven-pound roast was set before him. He picked up carving utensils. "Are you too selfish to care about anybody else? Doesn't your mother mean anything to you?"<br>Blair, her jaw clenched, looked at her mother. Opal was like a faded copy of her beautiful daughters. It was obvious that what spirit she'd ever had was either gone or deeply buried. "Mother," Blair said, "do you want me to return to Chandler, marry some fat banker, have a dozen children and give up medicine?"<br>Opal smiled fondly at her daughter as she took a small helping of eggplant from the platter held by a maid. "I want you to be happy, dear, and I believe it's rather noble of you to want to save people's lives."<br>Blair turned triumphant eyes toward her stepfather. "Houston's given up her life in order to please you. Isn't that enough for you? Do you have to see me broken too?"<br>"Houston!" Duncan thundered, clutching the big carving knife until his knuckles were white. "Are you going to allow your sister to say such things?"<br>Houston looked from her sister to her stepfather. Under no circumstances did she want to side with either one of them. When Blair returned to Pennsylvania after the wedding, Houston'd still be in the same town with her stepfather. With joy, she heard the downstairs maid announce Dr. Leander Westfield.<br>Quickly, Houston stood. "Susan," she said to the serving maid, "set another place."<br>Leander walked into the room with long, confident strides. He was tall, slim, dark, extremely good-looking with green eyes to die for, as a friend of Houston's once said -- and exuded an air of self-assurance that made women stop on the street and stare. He greeted Mr. and Mrs. Gates.<br>Leander leaned across the edge of the table and gave Houston a quick kiss on the cheek. Kissing a woman, even your wife, and certainly your fianc�e, so publicly was outrageous, but Leander had an air about him that allowed him to get away with things other men couldn't.<br>"Will you have dinner with us?" Houston asked politely, indicating the place set next to her.<br>"I've eaten, but maybe I'll join you for a cup of coffee. Good evening, Blair," he said as he sat down across from her.<br>Blair only glanced at him in answer as she poked at the food on her plate.<br>"Blair, you'll speak to Leander properly," Duncan commanded.<br>"That's all right, Mr. Gates," Leander replied pleasantly, but looking at Blair in puzzlement. He smiled at Houston. "You're as pretty as a bride today."<br>"Bride!" Blair gasped, standing and nearly upsetting her chair before she ran from the room.<br>"Why, that -- ," Duncan began, putting down his fork and starting to rise.<br>But Houston stopped him. "Please don't. Something's upsetting her badly. Perhaps she misses her friends in Pennsylvania. Leander, didn't you want to talk to me about the wedding? Could we go now?"<br>"Of course." Leander silently escorted her to his waiting buggy, clucked to the horse and drove her up the steep end of Second Street and parked on one of the many dead ends in Chandler. It was beginning to get dark and the mountain air was growing cold. Houston moved back into the comer of the carriage.<br>"Now, tell me what's going on," he said as he tied the horse's reins, put on the brake, and turned to her. "It seems to me that you're as upset as Blair."<br>Houston had to blink back tears. It was so good to be alone with Lee. He was so familiar, so safe. He was an oasis of sanity in her life. "It's Mr. Gates. He's always antagonizing Blair, telling her she's no good, reminding her that even as a child he thought there was no hope for her, and he's always demanding that she give up medicine and remain in Chandler. And, Lee, he keeps telling Blair how perfect I am."<br>"Ah, sweetheart," Lee said, pulling her into his arms, "you <i>are</i> perfect. You're sweet and kind and pliable and -- ." She pulled away from him. "Pliable! You mean like taffy?" "No," Lee smiled at her, "I just meant that you're a pretty, sweet woman, and I think it's good of you to be so worried about your sister, but I also think Blair should have been prepared for some criticism when she became a doctor."<br><i>"You</i> don't think she should give up medicine, do you?"<br>"I have no idea what your sister should do. She's not my responsibility." He reached for her again. "What are we talking about Blair for? We have our own lives to live."<br>As he spoke, his arms tightened around her and he began to nuzzle her ear.<br>This was the part of their courtship Houston always hated. Lee was so easy to be around, someone she knew so well. After all, they'd been a "couple" since she was six and he was twelve. Now, at twenty-two, she'd spent a great deal of time near Leander Westfield, had known forever that she was going to be Mrs. Westfield. All her schooling, everything she'd ever learned was in preparation for the day she'd be Lee's wife.<br>But a few months ago, after he'd returned from studying in Europe, he'd started this kissing, pushing her into the buggy seat, groping at her clothes, and all she'd felt was that she wished he'd stop fumbling at her. Then Lee'd get angry, once again call her an ice princess, and take her home.<br>Houston knew how she was supposed to react to Lee's touch. For all its appearance of staidness, Chandler, Colorado, was an enlightened town -- at least its women were -- but for the life of her Houston felt nothing when Lee touched her. She'd cried herself to sleep with worry many times. She couldn't imagine loving anyone more than she loved Leander, but she was just not excited by his touch.<br>He seemed to sense what Houston was thinking and drew away from her, his anger showing in his eyes.<br>"It's fewer than three weeks," she said with hope in her voice. "In a short time we'll be married and then..."<br>"And then what?" he said, looking at her sideways. "The ice princess melts?"<br>"I hope so," she whispered, mostly to herself. "No one hopes so more than I do."<br>They were silent for a moment.<br>"Are you ready for the governor's reception tomorrow?" Lee asked, pulling a long cheroot from his pocket and lighting it.<br>Houston gave him a trembling smile. These few minutes after she'd turned him down were always the worst. "My Worth gown's steamed and ready."<br>"The governor will love you, you know that?" He smiled at her, but she sensed he was forcing the smile. "Someday I'll have the most beautiful wife in the state at my side."<br>She tried to relax. A governor's reception was a place she felt confident. This was something she was trained for. Perhaps she should have taken a course in how not to be a cold, sexless wife. She knew that some men thought their wives shouldn't enjoy sex, but she also knew Leander was like no one else. He'd explained to her that he expected her to enjoy him and Houston'd told herself she would, but mostly she felt annoyed when Leander kissed her.<br>"I have to go to town tomorrow," he said, interrupting her thoughts. "Want to come along?"<br>"I'd love to. Oh! Blair wanted to stop by the newspaper office. I believe someone sent her a new medical journal from New York."<br>Houston leaned back in the carriage as Leander clucked to the horse and wondered what he'd say if he knew his "pliable" intended was, once a week, doing something that was quite illegal.<br><br>Blair lounged against the end of the ornate, canopied, walnut bed, one knee bent, showing the separation of her Turkish pants. Her big blue and white room was on the third floor, with a beautiful view of Ayers Peak out the west window. She'd had a room on the second floor with the rest of the family, but after she'd left Chandler when she was twelve, Opal'd become pregnant and Mr. Gates had made her room into a bath and a nursery. Opal lost the child and the room stood unused now, filled with dolls and toy soldiers Mr. Gates had bought.<br>"I really don't see why we have to go with Leander," Blair said to Houston who sat quite straight on a white brocade chair. "I haven't seen you in years and now I have to share you."<br>Houston gave her sister a little smile. "Leander asked us to accompany him, not the other way around. Sometimes I think you don't like him. But I can't see how that could be possible. He's kind, considerate, he has position in the community and he --."<br>"And he completely owns you!" Blair exploded, jumping up from the bed, startling Houston with the strength of her outburst. "Don't you realize that in school I worked with women like you, women who were so unhappy they repeatedly attempted suicide?"<br>"Suicide? Blair, I have no idea what you're talking about. I have no intention of killing myself." Houston couldn't help drawing away from her sister's vehemence.<br>"Houston," Blair said quietly, "I wish you could see how much you've changed. You used to laugh, but now you're so distant. I understand that you've had to adjust to Gates, but why would you choose to marry a man just like him?"<br>Houston stood, putting her hand on the walnut dresser and idly touching Blair's silver-backed hairbrush. "Leander isn't like Mr. Gates. He's really very different. Blair" -- she looked at her sister in the big mirror -- "I love Leander," she said softly. "I have for years, and all I've ever wanted to do is get married, have children and raise my family. I never wanted to do anything great or noble like you seem to want to do. Can't you see that I'm happy?"<br>"I wish I could believe you," Blair said sincerely. "But something keeps me from it. I guess I hate the way Leander treats you, as if you were already his. I see the two of you together and you're like a couple who've lived together for twenty years."<br>"We have been together a long time." Houston turned back to face her sister. "What should I look for in a husband if it isn't compatibility?"<br>"It seems to me that the best marriages are between people who find each other interesting. You and Leander are too much alike. If he were a woman, he'd be a perfect lady."<br>"Like me," Houston whispered. "But I'm not <i>always</i> a lady. There are things I do --."<br>"Like Sadie?"<br>"How did you know about that?" Houston asked.<br>"Meredith told me. Now, what do you think your darling Leander is going to say when he finds out that you're putting yourself in danger every Wednesday? And how will it look for a surgeon of his stature to be married to a practicing criminal?"<br>"I'm not a criminal. I'm doing something that's good for the whole town," Houston said with fire, then quieted. She slipped another hairpin invisibly into the neat chignon at the back of her head. Carefully arranged curls framed her forehead beneath a hat decorated with a spray of iridescent blue feathers. "I don't know what Leander will say. Perhaps he won't find out."<br>"Hah! That pompous, spoiled man will forbid you to participate in anything dealing with the coal miners and, Houston, you're so used to obeying that you'll do exactly what he says."<br>"Perhaps I should give up being Sadie after I'm married," she said with a sigh.<br>Suddenly, Blair dropped to her knees on the carpet and took Houston's hands. "I'm worried about you. You're not the sister I grew up with. Gates and Westfield are eating away at your spirit. When we were children, you used to throw snowballs with the best of them but now it's as if you're afraid of the world. Even when you do something wonderful like drive a huckster wagon, you do it in secret. Oh, Houston -- ."<br>She broke off at a knock on the door. "Miss Houston, Dr. Leander is here."<br>"Yes, Susan, I'll be right down." Houston smoothed her skirt. "I'm sorry you find me so much to your distaste," she said primly, "but I <i>do</i> know my own mind. I want to marry Leander because I love him." With that, she swept out of the room, and went downstairs.<br>Houston tried her best to push Blair's words from her mind but she couldn't. She greeted Leander absently and was vaguely aware of a quarrel going on between Lee and Blair, but she really heard nothing except her own thoughts.<br>Blair was her twin, they were closer than ordinary sisters and Blair's concern was genuine. Yet, how could Houston even think of not marrying Leander? When Leander was eight years old, he'd decided he was going to be a doctor, a surgeon who saved people's lives, and by the time Houston met him, when he was twelve, Lee was already studying textbooks borrowed from a distant cousin. Houston decided to find out how to be a doctor's wife.<br>Neither wavered from his decision. Lee went to Harvard to study medicine, then to Vienna for further study, and Houston went to finishing schools in Virginia and Switzerland.<br>Houston still winced whenever she thought of the argument she and Blair'd had about her choice of schools. "You're going to give up an education just so you can learn to set a table, so you can learn how to walk into a room wearing fifty yards of heavy satin and not fall on your face?"<br>Blair went to Vassar, then medical school, while Houston went to Miss Jones's School for Young Ladies where she was put through years of rigorous training in everything from how to arrange flowers to how to stop men from arguing at the dinner table.<br>Now, Lee took her arm as he helped her into the buggy. "You look as good as always," he said close to her ear.<br>"Lee," Houston said, "do you think we find each other...interesting?"<br>With a smile, his eyes raked down her body, over the dress that glued itself to her tightly corseted, exaggerated hourglass figure. "Houston, I find you fascinating."<br>"No, I mean, do we have enough to talk about?"<br>He raised one eyebrow. "It's a wonder I can remember how to talk when I'm around you," he answered as he helped her into his buggy, and drove them the six blocks into the heart of Chandler.<br>Copyright � 1985 by Deveraux Inc.</p><h2>The Silent Service in World War II: The Story of the U.S. Navy Submarine Force in the Words of the Men Who Lived It</h2><p>When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the U.S. Navy had a total of 111 submarines. However, this fleet was not nearly as impressive as the number suggests. It was mostly a collection of aging boats from the late teens and early twenties, with only a few of the newer, more modern Gato-class boats. Fortunately, with the war in Europe was already two years old and friction with Japan ever-increasing, help from what would become known as the Silent Service in the Pacific was on the way: there were 73 of the new fleet submarines under construction. <br><br>The Silent Service in World War II tells the story of America&#x2019;s intrepid underwater warriors in the words of the men who lived the war in the Pacific against Japan. The enemy had already begun to deploy advanced boats, but the U.S. was soon able to match them. By 1943 the new Gato-class boats were making a difference, carrying the war not just to the Japanese Imperial Navy, but to the vital merchant fleet that carried the vast array of materiel needed to keep the land of the Rising Sun afloat. <br><br>As the war progressed, American success in the Solomons, starting with Guadalcanal, began to constrict the Japanese sea lanes, and operating singly or in wolfpacks they were able to press their attacks on convoys operating beyond the range of our airpower, making daring forays even into the home waters of Japan itself in the quest for ever more elusive targets. Also taking on Japanese warships, as well as rescuing downed airmen (such as the grateful first President Bush), U.S. submarines made an enormous contribution to our war against Japan.<br><br>This book takes you through the war as you learn what it was like to serve on submarines in combat, the exhilaration of a successful attack, and the terror of being depth-charged. And aside from enemy action, the sea itself could prove to be an extremely hostile environment as many of these stories attest. From early war patrols in obsolescent, unreliable S-boats to new, modern fleet submarines roving the Pacific, the forty-six stories in this anthology give you a full understanding of what it was like to be a U.S. Navy submariner in combat.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Acknowledgments<br>Glossary<br>Introduction<br>Hollywood and American Submarines<br><br>PART ONE: PREWAR AND EARLY WAR STORIES (1941&#x2013;1942)<br>1: Submarine School � BY CORNELIUS R.

Although you may have read these stories in the Polaris, it is worth the effort to read them again. I suspect that many of the AS readers and USSVI members have never read the Polaris so these are all new recollections. The book is designed for submariners and non-submariners alike as there is an excellent glossary at the beginning to define the abbreviations used. There are 46 separate &#x201c;sea stories&#x201d; that range from 1940 through 1945.

Profound, graceful, and transforming, <i>The Way of Woman </i>is a true celebration of feminine worth.<br><br>"In this book, Helen Luke has rendered her lifetimes' worth of understandings about the unique nature of the feminine psyche.

She was able to find a unique way through the polarities that get us all stuck: theory and personal insight, gender and a point beyond gender, psychology and spirituality, tradition and immediate perception, knowledge and wisdom. Better tos pend a day meditating on a single page of her writing than to read a stack of books for enlightenment." <br>--Thomas Moore, author of <i>Care of the Soul, Soul Mates, </i>and <i>Meditations<br><br></i>"In the Book of Proverbs it is written: 'Say to wisdom, you are my sister, and call insight your intimate friend.' Helen M. Luke was such a sister and such a friend.

On behalf of countless women and men, I say, 'Thank you, Helen. Thank you for guiding me to the courage of my own feminine depths. Thank you for strengthening me in finding my feminine voice. Thank you for steadfastly living the feminine values in a society that, consciously and unconsciously, despises them. Thank you for encouraging me to go where I might never have dared go alone. And thank you for shining the light into corridors where I have yet to go."<br>--Marion Woodman, author of <i>Leaving My Father's House</i>, from her foreword</p></p><p>Equality of value between men and women is an eternal truth, but this does not mean that men and women are not psychically and spiritually different -- profoundly so. A woman must live her life as a woman, with a woman's values, or she fails. In <i>The Way Of Woman</i>, Luke drew from the riches of the Bible, mythology, folklore, Greek tragedies, and modern poetry to reconnect women with lost feminine images, symbols, and values. She speaks with the power of a true sage on continuity, relationships, the women's movement, marriage and divorce, and mothering.

The authors were eye witnesses to some of the great events of history and offer different prospectives from that found elsewhere. For example, we learn that when Calvin Coolidge announced in 1927 that he did not intend to run for re-election, he was playing hard-to-get. He believed that the people would insist that he accept a third term of office. He expected to be drafted. He actually wanted a third term in office. Coolidge was disappointed when Herbert Hoover was nominated as he disagreed with Hoover&#39;s ideas and policies. We learn that in the last year and a half of the presidency of President Woodrow Wilson, he had to be wheeled around the White House in a wheel chair and was often engaged in &#34;sickbed rambling&#34;. The unique prospective offered by this book arises from the fact that the authors are two White House domestic servants, each of whom worked for 30 years in the White House. As there was an overlap of ten years that both of them worked there together, that means that they were in the White House for a 51-year span from the end of 1909 until 1960, when Lillian Rogers Parks retired at age 64 in the concluding days of the Eisenhower Administration.</p><p>Lillian Rogers Parks worked in the White House as a seamstress for more than 30 years from 1929 until 1960.</p><h2>Fame: The Hijacking of Reality</h2><p><p>"Wholly riveting."<br>--<b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p>"Justine Bateman was famous before selfies replaced autographs, and bags of fan mail gave way to Twitter shitstorms.

The media seized hold of the story and, in the process, helped to launch one of the most devastating health scares ever. In the years to come Wakefield would be revealed as a profiteer in league with class-action lawyers, and he would eventually lose his medical license. Meanwhile one study after another failed to find any link between childhood vaccines and autism. <br><br>Yet the myth that vaccines somehow cause developmental disorders lives on. Despite the lack of corroborating evidence, it has been popularized by media personalities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jenny McCarthy and legitimized by journalists who claim that they are just being fair to &#x201c;both sides&#x201d; of an issue about which there is little debate. Meanwhile millions of dollars have been diverted from potential breakthroughs in autism research, families have spent their savings on ineffective &#x201c;miracle cures,&#x201d; and declining vaccination rates have led to outbreaks of deadly illnesses like Hib, measles, and whooping cough. Most tragic of all is the increasing number of children dying from vaccine-preventable diseases. <br><br>In <i>The Panic Virus </i>Seth Mnookin draws on interviews with parents, public-health advocates, scientists, and anti-vaccine activists to tackle a fundamental question: How do we decide what the truth is?

Kelly&#x2019;s parents had also come over: There was a father-daughter dance at the local church that evening, and Kelly and her dad were double-dating with Dan and Ashley. As the four of them were getting ready to leave, Kelly couldn&#x2019;t resist needling her mother. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re stuck with the boys,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;we won&#x2019;t be out too late.&#x201d; She kissed Stephen goodbye, and then bent down to say good night to Matthew. He was three years old, and Kelly marveled at how quickly he was growing up: It seemed as if it was only moments ago that he&#x2019;d been an infant, and now he was already being toilet-trained. (Dan and Kelly both agreed that it was adorable how proudly he announced that he had to go to the bathroom.)<br><br>For a brief moment, Kelly says, she wondered if Matthew was okay&#x2014;he seemed a little out of sorts, and earlier that afternoon, he&#x2019;d complained of a sore throat&#x2014;but then she figured he&#x2019;d probably just tired himself out wrestling with his older brother.<br><br>Kelly and Dan returned home that night around eight o&#x2019;clock. They&#x2019;d barely walked in the door when Kelly&#x2019;s mother rushed over: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Matthew,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s running a fever&#x2014;and his breathing seems a little shallow.&#x201d; The Laceks realized right away that something was seriously wrong. &#x201c;He was just sort of hunched over,&#x201d; Kelly says. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t know what to do.&#x201d; Since there was no way to get in touch with Matthew&#x2019;s doctor, they decided to make the ten-minute drive from their home in Monroeville, about fifteen miles east of Pittsburgh, to the Forbes Regional Campus of the Western Pennsylvania Hospital.<br><br>When the Laceks arrived at the emergency room, the attending physician told them there was nothing to worry about. In all likelihood, he said, Matthew had a case of strep throat. Worst-case scenario, it was asthma; regardless, they&#x2019;d be home in no time. Two hours later, they were feeling much less assured: Matthew&#x2019;s fever was still rising, and when a doctor tried to swab his throat, he began to choke. By eleven p.m. Matthew&#x2019;s temperature had risen to 104 degrees and his breathing seemed to be growing shallower by the minute.<br><br>It was around that time that a doctor the Laceks hadn&#x2019;t met before walked over. He was older&#x2014;probably in his sixties, Kelly thought&#x2014;and as soon as he saw Matthew, he began to suck nervously on his teeth. He turned to the Laceks: Had Matthew received all his shots? Actually, Kelly said, he hadn&#x2019;t. Matthew had been born in March 2003, several years after rumors of a connection between autism and vaccines had begun to gain traction in suburban enclaves around the country. That May, Kelly&#x2019;s chiropractor warned her about the dangers of vaccines. &#x201c;He asked if we were going to get [Matthew] vaccinated and I said yes,&#x201d; Kelly says. &#x201c;And then he told me about mercury. He said, &#x2018;There&#x2019;s mercury in there.&#x2019; &#x201d; Kelly had already heard rumors that the combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was dangerous, but this was something new. &#x201c;He was really vocal about it causing autism. He said there was this big report over in Europe and blah blah blah. And I thought, Well, I&#x2019;m surrounded by people who have autistic children. What if this happened to Matthew?&#x201d; If Kelly was unconvinced, the chiropractor said, she should make Matthew&#x2019;s pediatrician prove to her that the vaccines Matthew was scheduled to receive were one hundred percent safe.<br><br>&#x201c;So that&#x2019;s what I did,&#x201d; Kelly says. &#x201c;I asked my doctor if she could give me a label that says there&#x2019;s no mercury and she said, &#x2018;No.&#x2019; She said she wouldn&#x2019;t give it to me.&#x201d; It was as if, Kelly says, her pediatrician was hiding something. The doctor tried to tell Kelly that she would be putting Matthew at serious risk by not immunizing him, but, Kelly says, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I heard anything else she might have said, quite honestly. At that point I had lost faith.&#x201d;<br><br>From that day forward, Matthew didn&#x2019;t receive any of his scheduled vaccinations, including one for a bacterial disease called <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b, or Hib. Oftentimes, a Hib infection is not particularly threatening&#x2014;if the germs stay in the nose and throat, it&#x2019;s likely the child won&#x2019;t get sick at all&#x2014;but if the infection travels into the lungs or the bloodstream, it can result in hearing loss or permanent brain damage. Hib can also cause severe swelling in the throat due to a condition called epiglottitis, which, if not treated immediately, results in infected tissue slowly sealing off the victim&#x2019;s windpipe until he suffocates to death. As recently as the 1970s, tens of thousands of children in America had severe Hib infections each year. Many of those suffered from bacterial meningitis, and between five hundred and one thousand died. After the Hib vaccine was put into widespread use, the disease all but disappeared in the United States: In 1980, approximately 1 in 1,000 children caught Hib; today, fewer than 1 in 100,000 do. In fact, the immunization had been so effective that out of everyone working in the Monroeville ER, the doctor who&#x2019;d asked Kelly Lacek about her son&#x2019;s vaccine history was the only one who had been practicing long enough to have seen an actual Hib infection in a child.<br><br>Until that night, Kelly had never given much thought to the potential repercussions of her decision not to have Matthew vaccinated. &#x201c;I must have read somewhere that after he turned three, he would have been okay for many of those diseases,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I thought he was in the clear.&#x201d; She was wrong. &#x201c;I have never seen a doctor panic so quickly,&#x201d; she says. If, as the doctor was all but certain was the case, Matthew had been infected, then everything that had been done to him in the hospital that night&#x2014;the examinations, the swabs, the breathing treatments&#x2014;had served only to further inflame his throat. It wasn&#x2019;t until Kelly saw her son&#x2019;s X-rays that she realized just how dire the situation was: It looked as if Matthew had a thumb lodged in his throat. &#x201c;I started to shake,&#x201d; Kelly says. &#x201c;There was just a tiny bit of airway left for him to breathe.&#x201d;<br><br>Within minutes, the entire emergency room was thrown into a frenzy. Kelly heard someone shout out, &#x201c;Page Children&#x2019;s!&#x201d; Then she heard a second command: &#x201c;Get Life Flight here right away.&#x201d; Finally, a doctor pulled the Laceks aside and explained the situation to them. &#x201c;If we don&#x2019;t get Matthew on a helicopter [to the Children&#x2019;s Hospital in Pittsburgh] right now, your son is probably going to die,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It could be within minutes.&#x201d; While they were waiting, the doctor said, Kelly had to make sure Matthew remained calm. &#x201c;I do not want you crying,&#x201d; the doctor said. &#x201c;I do not want you reacting to anything. If you are upset, Matthew will be upset, and that will make his throat close up more. If that happens he will suffocate.&#x201d; As if in a daze, Kelly went and picked up her son. It wasn&#x2019;t until she heard her teeth chattering that she realized she was shaking. She focused all her energy on trying to remain still.<br><br>While Kelly was holding Matthew, Dan Lacek was conferring with the hospital staff. It had rained earlier in the evening, and now the entire area was covered in fog, which made it too dangerous to land a helicopter. Matthew was going to have to make the trip to Pittsburgh in an ambulance&#x2014;but before he could be moved, he&#x2019;d have to be intubated. If that didn&#x2019;t work&#x2014;if there was not enough room in Matthew&#x2019;s throat for a breathing tube&#x2014;the doctors would try to perform a tracheotomy, which involves cutting into the windpipe in an effort to form an alternate pathway for air to get into the lungs. (The procedure is not without risk: The physicist Stephen Hawking lost his speech when the nerves that control the vocal cords were damaged during an emergency tracheotomy.) Once again, it fell to Kelly to keep her son calm. Fortunately, the tube slid down Matthew&#x2019;s throat. Unless it closed up so much that the tube was forced out, they&#x2019;d bought themselves a few more hours.<br><br>It was almost four in the morning when the Laceks arrived in Pittsburgh. Matthew was immediately placed in a medically induced coma. All the doctors could promise was that he&#x2019;d live through the night. &#x201c;They said something about not catching it quickly enough with the antibiotics,&#x201d; Kelly says. &#x201c;Even if he did recover, there was a good chance he would have permanent brain damage, or, best-case scenario, he would have hearing loss.&#x201d;<br><br>For forty-eight hours, Dan and Kelly Lacek&#x2019;s son remained in stable condition. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in shock,&#x201d; Kelly says. &#x201c;You never let your guard down. You&#x2019;re just so focused on him getting better.&#x201d; Then, on Tuesday, just as they were growing more hopeful, Matthew&#x2019;s blood pressure plummeted. The only thing the Laceks could think to do at that point was to ask their friends to pray for them.<br><br>When Kelly Lacek&#x2019;s chiropractor told her that vaccines had been linked to autism, he was repeating the most recent of hundreds of years&#x2019; worth of fears about vaccinations. The roots of this latest alarm dated back to 1998, when a British gastroenterologist named Andrew Wakefield claimed to have discovered a new gut disorder associated with the MMR vaccine&#x2014;and with autism. Wakefield based his conclusions on a case study of a dozen children who&#x2019;d been brought to his clinic at the Royal Free Hospital in London. Almost immediately, Wakefield&#x2019;s research methods and his interpretations, which had been published in the medical journal <i>The Lancet</i>, came under fire. Wakefield&#x2019;s response was to appeal to the public rather than to his colleagues: The medical establishment was so determined to discredit him, he said, because he threatened their hegemony by taking parents&#x2019; concerns seriously. The media took the bait, and despite Wakefield&#x2019;s lack of proof and his track record of dubious assertions and unverified lab results, they began churning out stories about how a maverick doctor was trying to protect innocent children from corrupt politicians and a rapacious pharmaceutical industry. Within months, vaccination rates across Western Europe began to fall.<br><br>Then, a year later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) publicly recommended the removal of a widely used mercury-based preservative called thimerosal from childhood shots. The move had been hotly debated; in the end, one of the factors that had tipped the balance was a concern that following the Wakefield brouhaha, any connection, real or rumored, between vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders had a chance of unraveling public confidence in vaccines.<br><br>That fear proved to be well founded, in no small part because of the growing hold autism had on the public&#x2019;s consciousness. In the half-century since &#x201c;infantile autism&#x201d; had been defined as a discrete medical condition, it had gone from being a source of shame for parents, who were blamed for their children&#x2019;s conditions, to becoming a seemingly omnipresent concern, especially among those well-educated, upper-middle-class families for whom child rearing had become an all-encompassing obsession.<br><br>In spite of this increased attention, researchers in the 1990s were barely any closer to understanding autism&#x2019;s origins or devising effective therapies for its treatment than their predecessors had been fifty years earlier. For parents of autistic children, this lack of reliable information resulted in feelings of hopelessness and frustration; for parents in general trying to determine the best course of action for the future, it fueled a sense that medical experts and health authorities couldn&#x2019;t be counted on to look out for their families&#x2019; well-being.<br><br>Together, these reactions prepared the ground for new hypotheses to take root, regardless of how speculative or scientifically dubious they were. In the year following the CDC/AAP recommendations regarding thimerosal, a small group of parents decided that some of the symptoms of mercury poisoning seemed to match the behavior they saw in their autistic children&#x2014;and they suddenly realized that their children had appeared to be fine before they&#x2019;d received their vaccines. These parents began posting their observations online, sparking hundreds more parents to confirm that they&#x2019;d noticed the exact same thing. With a network of nontraditional doctors and alternative health practitioners urging them on, they became more and more convinced that the common threads that ran through their stories were too odd and too widespread to be mere happenstance.<br><br>The more these newly politicized parents learned, the more outraged they became. Why were children with weak immune systems injected with vaccines just as potent as those used on children in perfect health? Why was everyone instructed to receive the same number of inoculations, regardless of their medical histories or family backgrounds? Why, for that matter, were more and more shots being added all the time? Was a chicken pox vaccine really necessary? Or one for the flu?<br><br>Just as had been the case with the MMR vaccine, there was no concrete evidence linking thimerosal to autism, and the anecdotal corroboration often seemed more impressive than it actually was. (To take but one example: Despite superficial similarities, the motor difficulties exhibited by people with mercury poisoning bear little resemblance to the repetitive movements typical of autistics.) That didn&#x2019;t stop the American media from reacting much the same way their colleagues across the Atlantic had when Andrew Wakefield had published his assertions, as the emotional pull of stories featuring sick children and devoted parents outstripped anything as boring as hard data or the precautionary principle. In a matter of months, an ad hoc coalition of &#x201c;Mercury Moms&#x201d; transformed itself into a potent political force: Senators spoke at their rallies, public health officials tried to assuage their concerns, and federal agencies included them in discussions on how to spend tens of millions of dollars. Soon, vaccination rates began to fall in the United States as well.<br><br>By the beginning of the new millennium, Wakefield&#x2019;s supporters and the proponents of the thimerosal link had joined forces to create an international cadre of vaccine skeptics whose message had an undeniable appeal: Parents trying to do nothing so much as raise their children had been taken advantage of by a society they had trusted&#x2014;and now they were determined to make it right.<br><br>� � �<br><br>Over the past two decades, the instant accessibility of information has dramatically reshaped our relationship to the world of knowledge. Five hundred years after Gutenberg&#x2019;s introduction of the printing press and Martin Luther&#x2019;s translation of the Bible let common people bypass the priestly class, the vernacular of twenty-four-hour news channels and Internet search engines is freeing us to take on tasks that we&#x2019;d long assumed were limited to those with specialized training. Why, after all, should we pay commissions to real estate brokers or stock analysts when we can find online everything we need to sell our houses or manage our investments? And why should we blindly follow doctors when we can diagnose our own ailments?<br><br>One of the first effects of this hyper-democratization of data was to unmoor information from the context required to understand it.

Here are myths of gods, heroes and warriors; legends of Buddha, and of the goddess Benten and the god Daikoku; tales of the sea and of Mount Fuji; accounts of superstitions and supernatural beings; observations on the spiritual properties of fans, flowers, dolls and butterflies and much more.<br>The collection begins with the early myths of Japan, which the author describes as "quaint, beautiful, quasi-humorous." These are followed by legends celebrating early heroes and warriors, and the earliest examples of the Japanese romance, "The Bamboo-Cutter and the Moon-Maiden." Many of the legends that follow reflect a poetic love of beauty and of nature. But as the author points out, "there is plenty of crude realism in Japanese legend. We are repelled by the Thunder God's favorite repast, amazed by the magical power of foxes and cats; and the story of 'H&#x14d;�chi-the-Earless' and of the corpse-eating priest afford striking examples of the combination of the weird and the horrible."<br>Thirty-two full-page illustrations offer compelling images of Buddha and the Dragon; A Kakemono Ghost; The Jelly-Fish and the Monkey; The Firefly Battle; Tokoyo and the Sea Serpent; Sengen, the Goddess of Mount Fuji; and other subjects of these timeless myths. In addition, the author has included several invaluable appendixes that offer a helpful note on Japanese poetry, a listing of gods and goddesses, a genealogy of The Age of the Gods, and an index of poetical quotations.</p><p></p><h2>The Father Hunt (Nero Wolfe)</h2><p>All pretty Amy Denovo wants to find the father she has never seen, but she can&#x2019;t afford Nero Wolfe&#x2019;s outlandish fees . . . or can she? Suddenly she&#x2019;s knocking on the oversized detective&#x2019;s door with a parcel full of bills in hand&#x2014;and a quarter of a million hidden in her closet. It&#x2019;s all part of a nest egg left by her unknown father. But when Wolfe and his able assistant, Archie Goodwin, begin to trace the money to the man, they make a startling discovery: Amy&#x2019;s father murdered her mother&#x2014;and now he may be after her.<br><br> <b>&#x201c;It is always a treat to read a Nero Wolfe mystery. The man has entered our folklore.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p><b>Rex Stout</b> (1886&#x2013;1975) wrote dozens of short stories, novellas, and full-length mystery novels, most featuring his two indelible characters, the peerless detective Nero Wolfe and his handy sidekick, Archie Goodwin.Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> It happens once or twice a week. Lily Rowan and I, returning from a show or party or hockey game, leave the elevator and approach the door of her penthouse on top of the apartment building on Sixty-third Street between Madison and Park, and there is the key question. Mine is, Do I stay back and let her do it? Hers is, Does she stay back and let me do it? We have never discussed it, and it is always handled the same way. When she gets out her key as we leave the elevator she gives me a smile which means, &#x201c;Yes, you have one, but it&#x2019;s my door,&#x201d; and I smile back and follow her to it. It is understood that mine is for situations that seldom arise.<br> &nbsp;<br> That Thursday afternoon in August we had been to Shea Stadium to watch the Mets clobber the Giants, which they had done, 8 to 3, and it was only twenty past five when she used her key. Inside, she called out to Mimi, the maid, that she was home, and went to the bathroom, and I went to the bar in a corner of the oversized living room, with its 19-by-34 Kashan rug, for gin and ice and tonic and glasses. By the time I got out to the terrace with the tray she was there, at a table under the awning, studying the scorecard I had kept.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; she said as I put the tray down, &#x201c;Harrelson got three hits and batted in two runs. If he was here I&#x2019;d hug him. Good.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;m glad he&#x2019;s not here.&#x201d; I gave her her drink and sat. &#x201c;If you hugged that kid good you&#x2019;d crack a rib.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A voice came. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going, Miss Rowan.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Our heads turned. The young woman in the doorway to the living room was a newcomer to the penthouse. I had seen her only twice, and she was easy to look at, with just enough round places, just round enough, properly spotted on her five-foot-four getup, and her warm dark skin just right for her quick brown eyes. Her dark-brown hair was bunched at the back. Her name was Amy Denovo and she had got a diploma from Smith in June. Lily had hired her ten days ago, at a hundred a week, to help her find and arrange material for a book a man was going to write about Lily&#x2019;s father, who had made a pile building sewers and other items and had left her enough boodle to keep a dozen penthouses.<br> &nbsp;<br> She answered a couple of questions Lily asked, and left, and we talked baseball, concentrating on what the Mets had, if anything, besides Tommy Davis and Bud Harrelson and Tom Seaver, and what they might have if we lived long enough. We dawdled with the drinks, and at six o&#x2019;clock I got up to go, leaving Lily plenty of time to change for a dinner she had been hooked for, where people were going to abolish ghettos by making speeches. I had a date, later, where I intended to abolish the welfare of some friends of mine by drawing another ace or maybe jack.<br> &nbsp;<br> But down in the lobby I was intercepted. Albert, the doorman, was moving to open the door for me when a voice spoke my name and I turned, and Amy Denovo left a chair and was coming. She gave me a nice little smile and said, &#x201c;Could you give me a few minutes to ask you something?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I said, &#x201c;Sure, shoot,&#x201d; and she glanced at Albert, and he took the hint and went outside. I said we might as well sit and we went to a bench at the wall, but the door opened again and a man and woman entered, crossed to the elevator, and stood.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amy Denovo said, &#x201c;It is rather public, isn&#x2019;t it? I said a few minutes, but I suppose&nbsp;...&nbsp;it might be more than just a few. If you could? And I&nbsp;...&nbsp;it&#x2019;s very personal.... I mean personal to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t noticed the dimples before. They are always more taking on a dark skin than on a light skin. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re twenty-two,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> She nodded.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then maybe one minute will do it. Don&#x2019;t marry him now, you&#x2019;re too young to know. Wait a year at least, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, it isn&#x2019;t that! It&#x2019;s very personal.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think marriage isn&#x2019;t personal. It&#x2019;s too damn personal, that&#x2019;s the trouble. If you mean a few hours, not a few minutes, I&#x2019;m sorry; I have an eight o&#x2019;clock date, but there&#x2019;s a place around the corner that sells drinks and makes good egg-and-anchovy sandwiches. If you like anchovies.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The door opened and two women entered and headed for the elevator. That was not the place to discuss very personal matters.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was all right to walk with, no leading or lagging and no silly step-stretching. At that time of day in August there was plenty of room in the back at The Cooler, and we got the corner table where Lily and I had often had a snack. When the waitress had taken our order and left, I asked if she wanted to put off being personal until we had something inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> She shook her head. &#x201c;I might as well&nbsp;...&#x201d; She let it hang ten seconds and then blurted, &#x201c;I want you to find my father.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I raised a brow. &#x201c;Have you lost him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. I haven&#x2019;t lost him&nbsp;...&nbsp;because I never had him.&#x201d; She said it fast, as if someone was trying to stop her. &#x201c;I decided I had to tell somebody&#x2014;that was a month ago&#x2014;and then I got this job with Miss Rowan and I found out that she knows you, and I met you, and of course I know about you and Nero Wolfe. But I don&#x2019;t want Nero Wolfe to do it, I want you to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There were no dimples, and the quick brown eyes were fastened on me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That won&#x2019;t work,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on full time with Mr. Wolfe, twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week when they&#x2019;re needed, and I don&#x2019;t take jobs on my own. But I have a loose hour&#x201d;&#x2014;I looked at my watch&#x2014;&#x201c;and twenty minutes, and if you want a suggestion I might possibly have one. No charge.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But I need more than a suggestion.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not in a position to judge. You&#x2019;re too involved.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m involved all right.&#x201d; The eyes stayed at me. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t tell this to anybody but you. Not anybody. When I met you last week, the first time, I felt it then, I knew it, that you were the one man in the world that I could trust to do it. I never had that feeling about a man before&#x2014;or woman either.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just dandy,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but save the soap. Did you say you never had your father?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her eyes darted away as the waitress came with the drinks and sandwiches. When we had been served and were alone again she tried to smile. &#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t just figurative.&#x201d; She kept her voice low and I needed my good ears. &#x201c;I meant that literally. I never had a father. I don&#x2019;t know who he was. Is. I don&#x2019;t know what my name is, what it should be. Nobody knows about it&#x2014;nobody. Now you know. I don&#x2019;t think Denovo was my mother&#x2019;s real name. I don&#x2019;t think she was ever married. Do you know what Denovo means? Two Latin words, de novo?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Something about new. A nova is a new star.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It means &#x2018;anew.&#x2019; &#x2018;Afresh.&#x2019; She started anew, afresh, she started over, and she took the name Denovo. I wish I knew for sure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Have you asked her?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. I wanted to, I was going to, and now I can&#x2019;t. She&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When did she die?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In May. Just two weeks before I graduated. By a car. A hit-and-run driver.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did they get him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. They haven&#x2019;t found him. They are still looking; they say they are.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about relatives? A sister, a brother&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t any.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There must be. Everyone has relatives.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. None. Of course there might be some under her real name.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Have you got any? Cousins, uncles, aunts&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was getting messy. Or rather, it was getting too damn pure and simple. I knew people who liked to think of themselves as loners, but Amy Denovo really was one; with her it wasn&#x2019;t just thinking. I suggested that we might try the sandwiches, and she agreed and took one, and took a bite. Naturally, when I am eating with someone, male or female, for the first time, I notice the details of his or her performance, since it tells a lot about the person, but that time I didn&#x2019;t because the way she took a bite, or chewed, or swallowed, or licked her lips, had no bearing on the fix she was in. I did observe that there was nothing wrong with her appetite, and she proved that she liked the egg-and-anchovy combo by taking her full share. She asked if it was on Nero Wolfe&#x2019;s list of favorites, and I said no, he would probably sneer at it. When the platter was empty she said she hadn&#x2019;t thought it would make her hungry, telling someone the secret she had kept bottled up so long, but it had. She gave me a little smile, the dimples coming, and said, &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t really know ourselves, do we?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Your Face Never Lies: What Your Face Reveals About You and Your Health, an Introduction to Oriental Diagnosis</h2><p>A quick glance in the mirror can tell you much about your health. The shape of your face alone reveals a great deal. Your posture, skin tone, facial structures,&nbsp;and handwriting can tell you even more. They all reflect the vitality of your constitution at birth, the quality of your diet, and the strengths and weaknesses of your internal organs.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Your Face Never Lies</i> will lead you beyond the narrow limits of western medicine. Much more than a tool for helping those who are ill, the ancient skill described by macrobiotics expert Michio Kushi, will help you to better understand yourself, your life, and your relationship with nature. And, through the enhancement of your inherent observational abilities, this time-proven technique can begin to benefit you and those around you in only a few days.</p><p><b>Michio Kushi&nbsp;</b>(1926&#x2013;2014) was a leading figure in the macrobiotic movement. He began his study of macrobiotics more than fifty years ago and went on to establish the Kushi Institute in Massachusetts. As the leading voice in the macrobiotic community, he was the bestselling author of more than twenty books on the macrobiotic lifestyle.<b>Introduction</b><p><b>Oriental Diagnosis</b></p><p>The medicine of China, Japan and other countries of the Far East is among the oldest in the world. This medicine can teach us a great deal that can be practically applied today. The basic philosophy of Oriental medicine is the complementary opposite of the kind of medicine currently practised in the West. Western medicine, with its emphasis on the treatment of symptoms by drugs and surgery, is increasingly powerless to cope with the rising tide of degenerative illness that now threatens to engulf the industrialised world. Clearly we need to supplement our mainly symptomatic medicine with a medicine that is preventive in direction and humane and economical in application. Oriental medicine can contribute greatly to filling this need.</p><p>The standard Oriental writings on the causes of disease stressed the relationship between an individual&#x2019;s health and his or her diet, activity, spiritual attitude and total environment. No single aspect of human life was considered separate from another. The biological, psychological and spiritual were seen as related aspects of the totality. The practitioner was an adviser and teacher who could point out the source of a health problem and give practical suggestions for changes in life style that could ameliorate the problem at its source.</p><p>In Western medicine, diagnosis identifies a disease by observation of its symptoms. The experienced Oriental diagnostician, however, can foresee the development of sickness before the sick person has specific symptoms such as pain. The principal tool of Oriental diagnosis is physiognomy &#x2014; the art of judging a person &#x201c;from the features of the face or the form and lineaments of the body generally&#x201d; (Oxford English Dictionary). The basic premise of Oriental physiognomy is that each individual represents a walking history of his or her development. The strengths and weaknesses of our parents, the environment we were brought up in, and the food we have eaten are all expressed in our present condition. Our posture, the colour of our skin, the tone of our voice and other traits are externalisations of the condition of our blood, organs, nervous system, and skeletal structure, which in turn are the result of our heredity, diet, environment, and activity.</p><p>The secret of diagnostic skill is to recognise the signs of a particular set of changes before they become serious &#x2014; to see the signs that stones are developing in the kidneys, that the heart is becoming expanded, or that a cancer is developing &#x2014; even before these symptoms bring pain and discomfort. This type of diagnosis depends completely on the practitioner developing his or her own sensitivity and understanding fully the principles that underlie the techniques.</p></p><h2>U.S. Submarines Since 1945, Revised Edition: An Illustrated Design History</h2><p>In the tradition of his acclaimed warship design histories, Norman Friedman describes the forces--technical, political, and operational--that shaped a vital element of U.S. sea power. For example, he examines the evolution in missions, such as forward-based antisubmarine warfare and strategic deterrence, that transformed the submarine from its former subsidiary role to the center of national power. <i>U.S. Submarines Since 1945</i> is also the story of a technological revolution: first the emergence of fast diesel-electric craft, then the shock of nuclear power, followed by the appearance of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Nowhere else can a reader find so complete or sophisticated an account of the development of the U.S. submarine force, including not only the hulls, but also the weapons and sensors they carry. The book details what submarines were ordered, what weapons and propulsion systems they had, how they performed, and what sonars and combat systems were developed.<p>This illustrated design history contains more than 100 photographs and more than 100 line drawings, including specially commissioned artwork from technical illustrator James L. Christley. These exclusive illustrations, along with the incisive text, capture the excitement of a revolutionary period in submarine development. Enthusiasts and professionals alike will welcome the abundance of information offered.</p><p>In this revised edition, Norman Friedman explores what has happened since the Cold War, which means both new classes and new technology (some of it applied to existing submarines). New material includes weapons and sensors as they have developed since 1995. This new technology is explained in the context of very different post-Cold-War priorities. In addition, Friedman includes new information that has become available on submarines described in the earlier edition. <br><br></p></p><p><b>Norman Friedman</b> is one of America's most prominent naval analysts, and the author of more than thirty books covering a range of naval subjects, from warship histories to contemporary defense issues.<br>"<i>U.S. Submarines since 1945, Revised Edition</i> by Norman Friedman is a must read for all professionals, designers and scholars of modern submarines." --<b>The Australian Naval Institute</b><br><br>"The new edition of <i>US Submarines since 1945</i> is indispensable for anyone who wants to deal with submarine development and specifically with the US Navy.

Twelve-year-old Alice Winston is growing up fast on her father's run-down horse ranch--coping with the death of a classmate and the absence of her older sister (who ran off with a rodeo cowboy), trying to understand her depressed and bedridden mother, and attempting to earn the love and admiration of her reticent, weary father. Lyrical, powerful, and unforgettable, <i>The God of Animals</i> is our must-read, must-own, must-share book for March. <i>--Daphne Durham</i> <p> </p> <b>Amazon.com</b><br> With the sure hand of a seasoned writer, Aryn Kyle has crafted a brilliant debut with her novel, <i>The God of Animals</i>. Alice Winston, living on the family horse ranch, a marginal enterprise in Desert Valley, Colorado, is a 12-year-old girl with more than she can handle and no one to help her cope. Polly, a classmate of hers, drowned in the nearby canal and was carried out by Alice's father, Joe, a member of the volunteer posse. Her older sister, 16-year-old Nona, eloped with a rodeo cowboy. Her mother never leaves her bedroom, a case of clinical depression. "My mother had spent nearly my whole life in her bedroom... Nona said that one day, while I was still a baby, our mother had handed me to her, said she was tired, and gone upstairs to rest. She never came back down." <p> Joe has little time for Alice, other than counting on her to muck out the stalls and be polite to the paying customers. He doesn't even notice that she has outgrown her clothes. What Kyle does with this scenario is never predictable or clich�d. She writes beautifully of landscapes, interior and exterior, ravaged by extremes: the hottest summer in years, followed by a deluge; a lonely, isolated girl reaching out to a teacher, Mr. Delmar, equally alienated. </p><p> Alice starts telling lies, weaving bits and pieces of other people's lives into the tales she tells the teacher. What we eventually find out about her family is more poignant and tragic than anything she can make up. Horse lore is a large part of what explains each of the people in the novel: separating mares from their foals, the way a stud is treated, breaking a horse, ordinary everyday contact. This bond is explored in depth and each person: Alice, Nona, Joe, Joe's father, Alice's mother, is affected by this closeness in a different, unique way, revelatory of each individual's character. Much more than a coming-of-age tale, Kyle told a story of compromises and dreams that will never come true. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i> </p><p> </p> <b> 10 Second Interview: A Few Words with Aryn Kyle</b><br><br> <b>Q:</b> In 2004, your short story "Foaling Season," the first chapter of <i>The God of Animals</i>, won a National Magazine Award for Fiction for <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>. Did you have the idea for your book at the time you wrote the short story, or did the novel develop over time? <br> <b>A:</b> Three years passed between the time that I finished the short story and the time I returned to expand it into a novel. I was always interested in the characters and in the town which the story takes place, but after the story was published, I assumed I was done with them. In the aftermath of graduate school and a failed attempt at another novel, I found myself living back in my hometown of Grand Junction, Colorado, the town that Desert Valley is loosely based upon. More and more, I caught myself thinking about Alice again. I was interested in how the town had changed over the years, in the way that a tide of money and commercial culture was displacing the old families and the old ways. But mostly, I was interested in Alice's family, and in Alice's struggle to make a place for herself in a world that seems to have no place for her. The short story ended before she could really make any headway. I became curious as to where she might go and who she might become if the events of the story continued into the wider space of a novel. The story of <i>The God of Animals</i> starts with Chapter One, but I've always felt that the novel really starts with the second chapter.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> How much of your adolescence and personal experience are incorporated into your novel? Like Alice, did you ride horses growing up in Colorado?<br> <b>A:</b> Lots? None? This is a tricky question to answer. As far as lifestyle and experience, my own adolescence could not have been more different from Alice's. I didn't grow up on a ranch; didn't have a sister; my mother got out of bed and went to work every day. But adolescence is adolescence. Like Alice, I certainly know about loneliness, about longing, about regret, and about the confusion of trying to live in the world without really understanding it. Though, if I were going to be perfectly honest, I would have to admit that these are all things I found myself working through in my twenties, rather than in my teens. I did take riding lessons when I was about Alice's age, and I competed in a few local horse shows. It was such a different world from the one I'd grown up in, and though I gave it up when I started high school, I guess it made a pretty big impression on me.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> How did you think of the title?<br> <b>A:</b> The title didn't come to me until I'd finished the book. I was starting to panic a bit, figuring that no one would be too interested in publishing a book called Novel, which is what I'd named the file on my computer. So I did the only thing I could think of--I frantically thumbed through the pages of the draft waiting for something to pop out at me. I reread the scene between Alice and Mr. Delmar where they discuss God and spirituality. Something about that scene seemed to encapsulate some of the greater themes of the novel, the uncertainty Alice has about the world, her desire to believe in something larger than herself, her fears regarding isolation and loneliness.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> Do you have another novel in the works?<br> <b>A:</b> Lately, I've been working mainly on short stories. It's kind of hard for me to spend so much time working on one project, then dive into another. I've needed the time to get Alice's voice out of my head before I commit to another novel. But I do have a second novel underway--I'm superstitious, though, and it seems like bad luck to talk about something while its still in the works. Mostly, my writing starts with the characters, with understanding their flaws and their desires. Plot, for me, seems to come later, after I know what my characters want, and what they're willing to sacrifice to get it.<br> <p> <strong>Aryn Kyle's Favorite Coming-of-Age Novels</strong></p><p></p><table><tbody><tr> <td> <br><i>Housekeeping</i></td><td> <br><i>That Night</i></td><td> <br><i>Thumbsucker</i></td> <td> <br><i>Ghostworld</i></td> <td> <br><i>Atonement</i></td> </tr></tbody></table><br> See all 10 of Aryn Kyle's favorite coming-of-age novels (with commentary)<br><p></p> <p></p><b>Aryn Kyle</b> is the author of the bestselling novel <i>The God of Animals</i> and a graduate of the University of Montana writing program.&nbsp;Her short stories have appeared in&nbsp;<i>Ploughshares</i>, <i>The Georgia Review</i>, <i>Alaska Quarterly Review</i>,&nbsp;<i>Best New American Voices</i>&nbsp;2005, <i>Best American Short Stories 2007,</i> and<i>&nbsp;The Atlantic Monthly, </i>for which&nbsp;her story "Foaling Season" won a National Magazine Award.&nbsp;She is also the recipient of the American Library Association's Alex Award, the Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers&#x2019;Award, and others.&nbsp; She&nbsp;lives in New York.</p><h2>Jesus Abba: The God Who Has Not Failed</h2><p><p>The church has emphasized ideas about God that have marginalized Jesus' understanding of his spiritual Father, his Abba. We commonly think of God as a demanding lawgiver and judge, an omnipotent ruler, or an ultimate philosophical principle. None of these works well today.</p><p>In contrast, Jesus' view of God as spiritual Abba still truly works when it is given a chance. Christians should be open to accepting the ideas of the one they call Lord and Savior. In <i>Jesus' Abba</i>, one of the greatest theologians of this generation boldly argues for a new view of God, through the eyes of Jesus.</p><p>John B. Cobb Jr. interprets the whole of Jesus' life and ministry, and death and resurrection, in light of Jesus' understanding of God. He also shows that Paul shared this understanding and that it played a central role in Paul's churches. Ultimately, Cobb argues that Jesus' view of God fits our actual experience today, that it is supported by the evidence of the sciences, and that it encourages appreciative learning from other wisdom traditions and cooperation with them in redeeming the world.</p><p>With this book, John B. Cobb Jr. makes his ultimate and most impassioned plea for us to rediscover God through Jesus.</p></p><p>John B. Cobb Jr. is the global leader of process theology and one of the greatest theological minds of the last fifty years. He is professor of theology emeritus at Claremont School of Theology in Claremont, California, and the cofounder of the Center for Process Studies. He is the author of over thirty books, including <i>God and the World</i>.</p><h2>Birth of the Chess Queen: A History</h2><p><p>Everyone knows that the queen is the most dominant piece in chess, but few people know that the game existed for five hundred years without her. It wasn't until chess became a popular pastime for European royals during the Middle Ages that the queen was born and was gradually empowered to become the king's fierce warrior and protector.</p><p><em>Birth of the Chess Queen</em> examines the five centuries between the chess queen's timid emergence in the early days of the Holy Roman Empire to her elevation during the reign of Isabel of Castile. Marilyn Yalom, inspired by a handful of surviving medieval chess queens, traces their origin and spread from Spain, Italy, and Germany to France, England, Scandinavia, and Russia. In a lively and engaging historical investigation, Yalom draws parallels between the rise of the chess queen and the ascent of female sovereigns in Europe, presenting a layered, fascinating history of medieval courts and internal struggles for power.</p></p><p><p>Marilyn Yalom is a former professor of French and a senior scholar at the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University. She is the author of widely acclaimed books such as <em>A History of the Breast</em>, <em>A History of the Wife</em>, <em>Birth of the Chess Queen</em>, and, most recently, <em>How the French Invented Love</em>. She lives in Palo Alto, California, with her husband, psychiatrist and author Irvin D. Yalom.</p>A senior scholar at Stanford's Institute for Women and Gender who has written extensively on women's history, Yalom (A History of the Wife; etc.) sees the rise of female power throughout the centuries reflected in the history of the chess queen: "She has entered the academy of gendered icons, alongside the Earth Mother, the Amazon, and the Virgin Mary." For 500 years, chess was played in India, Persia and the Arab world minus a queen; she finally made her entrance in southern Europe around A.D. 1000. Drawing parallels between "symbolic queens on the chessboard and living queens at numerous royal courts," Yalom introduces readers to significant queens, empresses and countesses as she traces the spread of chess across Europe. With anecdotes, art, legends and literature, she shows how the chess queen became "the quintessential metaphor for female power in the Western world." Yalom offers an outstanding glimpse at chess as a courting ritual: "The chess queen and the cult of love grew up together and formed a symbiotic relationship, each feeding on the other." She also addresses the current status of female chess players&#x2014;only 5% of the world's chess players are women&#x2014;and wonders if "the best female players [will] ever be able to beat the best male players." Combining exhaustive research with a deep knowledge of women's history, Yalom presents an entertaining and enlightening survey that offers a new perspective on an ancient game.

What attitudes, behavior and qualities are good? Can we be good without God? What is the highest good, the purpose of human existence? These are the questions the study of ethics seeks to answer. Unlike many approaches to ethics, this book foundationally turns to Scripture, going only as far as Scripture itself goes. The result is an overview of biblical ethics that not only addresses the life of love and wisdom to be lived out by Christians as virtuous individuals, but also as Christians in community, in society and in a world of God?s creation. Key preliminary considerations of love, law, sin and virtue are given their due in this thoroughly revised and updated text. The bulk of the work is then organized around the Ten Commandments and ethical themes springing from them&#x2015;loving God (commandments 1-4) and loving others (commandments 6-10). This new edition includes added material on <ul><li>ethical alternatives such as relativism, social contract, utilitarianism and evolutionary ethics</li><li>the seven deadly sins as well as the cardinal virtues vs. theological virtues</li><li>end-of-life ethics, stem-cell research, animal rights, sexuality, genetics and technology, and other bioethical issues such as plastic surgery and surrogate motherhood </li><li>technology and its depersonalizing effects as well as helping the poor</li><li>the church?s engagement in society and how Christians can make a difference in the media.</li></ul> McQuilkin and Copan stay focused on how we are fulfilling the purposes of God for our lives&#x2015;a will that is for our good and our well-being. This comprehensive study is the place to begin on the journey of living wisely, faithfully and obediently.</p><p>Robertson McQuilkin served as the third president of Columbia International University for twenty-two years and is now president emeritus. His other books include <em>Five Smooth Stones, The Great Omission, A Promise Kept</em> and <em>Life in the Spirit</em>.<br><br>Paul Copan is the Pledger Family Chair of Philosophy and Ethics at Palm Beach Atlantic University. He has written several books, including <em>Creation Out of Nothing, Is God a Moral Monster?</em> and <em>That's Just Your Interpretation</em> and is coauthor of <em>The Gospel in the Marketplace of Ideas</em>."Ethics without the Bible is a matter of cultural mores. The Bible without ethics is a textual relic without life or relevance. This superb introduction to biblical ethics brings the two together through the wisdom of two noted evangelical thinkers and leaders. This book does not duck the tough issues but presents them in the light of God's unfailing revelation in Jesus Christ and the revelation of God in Holy Scripture. Highly recommended!" (Timothy George, founding dean of Beeson Divinity School of Samford University and general editor of the Reformation Commentary on Scripture)<br><br>"<em>An Introduction to Biblical Ethics</em> combines the winsome wisdom of Robertson McQuilkin, one of the sage professors of Christian ethics, with the penetrating rigor of Paul Copan, one of the premier thinkers of today. What could be better than this?" (C. Ben Mitchell, Graves Professor of Moral Philosophy, Union University, Jackson, Tennessee)<br><br>"A first-rate discussion of ethics from a Christian worldview. I'm very glad to see Robertson McQuilkin's work be updated by such a capable scholar as Paul Copan." (Scott B. Rae, dean of faculty, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University)<br><br>"Although as a Catholic I part ways with the authors on a couple of issues&#x2015;such as birth control and the use of images&#x2015;this is an amazingly careful piece of work. Robertson McQuilkin and Paul Copan offer to their readers a clear and compelling account of an evangelical Protestant understanding of biblical ethics, one from which those outside this tradition can learn much. What makes this book historically interesting is that it is a third edition of a classic originally authored by McQuilkin, a legendary figure in American evangelicalism and a pioneer in the field of contemporary biblical ethics. But now it has been revised and authored in collaboration with one of the most prolific Christian philosophers alive today, Copan. As one would expect, this rare combination of talents makes for an important contribution to the study of ethics." (Francis J. Beckwith, professor of philosophy and church-state studies, and codirector of the program on philosophical studies of religion, Baylor University)<br><br>"Insight and wisdom abound in this volume. Ethical instruction flows in a torrent of theologically informed, biblical exposition. I found myself constantly expecting to critique the book for being much wider than it is deep, but I was routinely surprised by the depth of insight the volume provides. Just as the Mississippi River proves that a river can be both deep and wide, so, too, this text proves that a single volume can display the breadth of biblical ethics with theological depth."

With each turn of the page, there are countless grisly reminders of the things human beings are capable of doing to one another: enslavement, murder, riot, combat, bombing, and on and on.</p><p>Beauty dances with horror on virtually every page.<br><br><b>BOOKLIST, Starred Review<br></b><br>This large-format book commemorates the 150th anniversary of the Civil War; the premise behind its publication is that &#x201c;never before have Civil War treasures from throughout the Smithsonian been assembled and interpreted in one place as they are here.&#x201d; The Smithsonian Institution, founded in 1846, currently comprises 19 museums and nine research centers, and from their vast collections have been photographed&#x2014;in exquisite clarity&#x2014;the &#x201c;most valuable, significant, and interesting&#x201d; Civil War&#x2013;related items, ranging from valuable documents to battle flags, surgical instruments used in the field, uniforms and weapons, and an abundance of photographs, some iconic, others rarely seen. The items are arranged into groupings by specific topic, each of these groupings introduced by context-setting brief essays written by 49 contributing specialists. These chapter-topics include &#x201c;Prewar Portraits&#x201d; (of famous people before the war); &#x201c;Sold Down the River&#x201d; (internal slave trafficking); &#x201c;Civil War Headgear&#x201d;; &#x201c;Letters Home&#x201d;; &#x201c;The Wartime Patent Office&#x201d; (the building housing it served as a barracks and, later, as a hospital during the war); and &#x201c;The Fate of Mary Lincoln.&#x201d; The very reasonable price for this gorgeous storehouse of information allows its purchase for all active American history collections. <i>&#x2014; Brad Hooper</i></p><p><b>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY<br><br></b>History is sometimes best told through the artifacts it leaves behind. As for the Civil War, the Smithsonian Institution&#x2019;s artifacts can communicate more than any textbook ever could, from a violin carried by a Union soldier to the canvas hoods forced on Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination conspirators. These and other haunted relics from the antebellum period through Reconstruction are found in <b>Smithsonian Civil War: Inside the National Collection (Smithsonian, $40)</b>. Museum curators each selected and wrote about a specific object from the collections, generating a total of 150 entries. You might call a number of these objects works of art, particularly the pottery of David Drake, the Edgefield, S.C., slave who inscribed witty couplets and short poems onto his vessels, such as &#x201c;Another trick is worst than this/Dearest Miss, spare me a kiss.&#x201d;<br><br><b>CHOICE<br></b><br>This outstanding hardback pictorial history opens the Civil War collections of the Smithsonian and presents them in a remarkably accessible, artistic, and informative fashion. &nbsp;The exceptional strength of this work is anchored on the astonishing Civil War collection of artifacts that the Smithsonian has within its vaults and on display, and subsequently reproduced in this volume. &nbsp;Though the emphasis is on the visual experience, the narrative overviews and item descriptions &nbsp;provide exceptional background and historical context for each chapter and component on display. &nbsp;While the book can be viewed as either a reference volume or a coffee-table pictorial history, anyone with an interest in the Civil War, from university professor to elementary school student, will be drawn in and able to utilize this unique masterpiece for projects ranging from a school report to assembling a manuscript for publication; all objects and images contain their respective Smithsonian catalog identification. Quite frankly, every home and every library in the US should own a copy of this timeless masterpiece. &nbsp;<b>Most highly recommended.</b> &nbsp;Summing Up: Essential. &nbsp;All levels/libraries &nbsp;of all types. -- <i>T.

How much can we know about the world? Is there such a thing as an ultimate truth?</b><br><br>To be human is to want to know, but what we are able to observe is only a tiny portion of what's out there.&#x201d; In <i>The Island of Knowledge</i>, physicist Marcelo Gleiser traces our search for answers to the most fundamental questions of existence. In so doing, he reaches a provocative conclusion: science, the main tool we use to find answers, is fundamentally limited.<br><br>These limits to our knowledge arise both from our tools of exploration and from the nature of physical reality: the speed of light, the uncertainty principle, the impossibility of seeing beyond the cosmic horizon, the incompleteness theorem, and our own limitations as an intelligent species. Recognizing limits in this way, Gleiser argues, is not a deterrent to progress or a surrendering to religion. Rather, it frees us to question the meaning and nature of the universe while affirming the central role of life and ourselves in it. Science can and must go on, but recognizing its limits reveals its true mission: to know the universe is to know ourselves.<br><br>Telling the dramatic story of our quest for understanding, <i>The Island of Knowledge</i> offers a highly original exploration of the ideas of some of the greatest thinkers in history, from Plato to Einstein, and how they affect us today. An authoritative, broad-ranging intellectual history of our search for knowledge and meaning, <i>The Island of Knowledge</i> is a unique view of what it means to be human in a universe filled with mystery.</p><p><b>Marcelo Gleiser</b> is Appleton Professor of Natural Philosophy and Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College. He has published numerous popular works, including an essay, Emergent Realities in the Cosmos,&#x201d; which was featured in 2003's <i>Best American Science Writing</i>, and three previous books: <i>The Dancing Universe</i>, <i>The Prophet and the Astronomer</i>, and <i>A Tear at the Edge of Creation</i>.Gleiser has a gift for telling a story grandly and clearly. His history is nothing if not thorough, beginning in early superstition and mythology and methodically working up to current scientific questions in cosmology and physics. Along the way, he touches on everything from philosophy to optics to artificial intelligence.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Science</i></b><br><br> Partway between Hannah Arendt's timeless manifesto for the unanswerable questions at the heart of meaning and Stuart Firestein's case for how not-knowing drives science, Gleiser explores our commitment to knowledge and our parallel flirtation with the mystery of the unknown. What emerges is at once a celebration of human achievement and a gentle reminder that the appropriate reaction to scientific and technological progress is not arrogance over the knowledge conquered, which seems to be our civilizational modus operandi, but humility in the face of what remains to be known and, perhaps above all, what may always remain unknowable.... <i>The Island of Knowledge</i> is an illuminating read in its totality.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Brain Pickings</i></b><br><br> [Gleiser] is a gifted writer.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Physics Today</i></b><br><br> Gleiser covers a broad swath of subjects from cognition and curved space to particle physics, superstring theory, and multiverses with a thoughtful, accessible style that balances philosophy with hard science. His island imagery will capture readers' imagination as it examines the ideas that unnerve us even as they illuminate our world.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review</b><br><br> <i>The Island of Knowledge</i> is a history of the mind, its gift for finding ideas in things. The brilliance of centuries of philosophic and scientific inquiry, never more remarkable than at present, bears a profound resemblance to the brilliance it discovers in the universe. Marcelo Gleiser makes us feel what a privilege it is to be human.&#x201d;<br><b> Marilynne Robinson, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Humanities Medal, and author of <i>Gilead</i> and <i>Absence of Mind: The Dispelling of Inwardness from the Modern Myth of the Self</i></b><br><br> We've come to know far more than our ancestors could possibly have imagined including the depth of our ignorance. In Gleiser's lucid narrative, that marvelous paradox comes alive.&#x201d;<br><b> Frank Wilczek, Nobel Laureate, and author of <i>The Lightness of Being</i></b><br><br> Marcelo Gleiser brings a physicist's knowledge, a philosopher's wisdom, and a poet's language to elucidate our largest questions. If you finish <i>The Island of Knowledge</i> with all the same opinions with which you began it, then turn to page one and start reading again.&#x201d;<br><b> Rebecca Goldstein, MacArthur Fellow, and author of <i>Plato at the Googleplex</i></b><br><br> Articulate, elegant, and at times poignant, <i>The Island of Knowledge</i> is a magnificent account of humanity's struggle to understand its place in the cosmos. Starting from ancient knowledge of the motions of stars and planets and progressing to contemporary scientific theories of the origins of space and time, Gleiser shows how our efforts to comprehend the universe have transformed it into something rich and strange.&#x201d;<br><b> Seth Lloyd, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, MIT, and author of <i>Programming the Universe</i></b><br><br> Gleiser writes very well. He introduces the necessary concepts along the way, and is remarkably accurate while using a minimum of technical details. Some anecdotes from his own research and personal life are nicely integrated with the narrative and he has a knack for lyrical imagery which he uses sparsely but well timed to make his points.&#x201d;<br><b> Sabine Hossenfelder, <i>Back Reaction blog</i></b><br><br> [Gleiser's] discussions of cosmology and multiple universes are compelling.... [<i>The Island of Knowledge</i>] probe[s] deep into one of the most difficult intellectual problems on the human agenda.... [A] thorough and clear guide to the philosophical problems posed by the nature of the subatomic world.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Washington Post</i></b><br><br> The quest goes on, always presenting us with new things to wonder about and to wonder at. Without that sense of wonder, as Mr. Gleiser's excellent book makes clear, there would be no point in doing science at all.&#x201d;<br><b> John Gribbin, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br> Gleiser, who puts his faith in humility and hope,' writes with thoughtfulness and sensitivity, and without assuming that our current state of scientific knowledge is any more complete or final than that of previous generations.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Columbia Dispatch</i></b><br><br> The process that shapes public policy often includes debate about what scientific evidence does, can and can't tell us. That debate can be enriched by this book.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</i></b></p><h2>Choral Repertoire</h2><p><em>Choral Repertoire</em> is the definitive and comprehensive one-volume presentation of the canon of the Western choral tradition.

But economists also analyze issues that, to others, typically do not fall within the realm of economic reasoning, such as organ transplants, cigarette addiction, overeating, and product safety. <i>Trade-Offs</i> is an introduction to the economic approach to analyzing these controversial public policy issues.</p> <p> </p> <p>Harold Winter provides readers with the analytical tools needed to identify and understand the trade-offs associated with these topics. By considering both the costs and benefits of potential policy solutions, Winter stresses that real-world decision making is best served by an explicit recognition of as many trade-offs as possible. This new edition incorporates recent developments in policy debates, including the rise of &#x201c;new paternalism,&#x201d; or policies designed to protect people from themselves; alternative ways to increase the supply of organs available for transplant; and economic approaches to controlling infectious disease.</p> <p> </p> <p>Intellectually stimulating yet accessible and entertaining, <i>Trade-Offs</i> will be appreciated by students of economics, public policy, health administration, political science, and law, as well as by anyone who follows current social policy debates.</p></p><p><p></p><b>Harold Winter</b> is professor of economics at Ohio University.<p></p>Praise for the first edition&#x201c;With shrewd verbal reasoning, Harold Winter brings home a number of concepts the general public has difficulty digesting. . . .

In the sixteenth century, diseases brought by the Spanish conquerors wiped out almost 90 per cent of the indigenous population. Since then, Mexico - first as a colony of Spain and, after 1821, as an independent nation - has exported thousands of tons of silver, affecting currencies and prices as far away as China and India. In the century following independence, Mexico was invaded six times by three different European nations (Britain, France, and Spain) as well as the United States, the latter conflict resulting in the loss of half of Mexico&#39;s territory. More recently, Mexico has played an ever more important part in the world economy. Focused primarily on the period since independence in 1821, this brief text effectively summarizes Mexico&#39;s rich history, delineating some of the major processes at the national level and hinting at regional and local counter-currents.</p><p><p><b>J�rgen Buchenau</b> is Professor of History and Director of Latin American Studies at UNC Charlotte.

These are morning poems, full of the delight and mystery of waking in a new day, and they also do their share of mourning, elegizing the deceases and capturing the 'moment of sorror before creation.' Some of the poems are dialogues where unconventional speakers include mice, maple trees, bundles of grain, the body, the 'oldest mind' and the soul. A particularly moving sequence involves Bly's imaginative transactions with a great and unlikely precursor, Wallace Stevens. The whole is a fascinating and original book from one of our most fascinating authors."<br> &#x2014; David Lehman </blockquote></p><p>Robert Bly's <i>Morning Poems</i> is a window into the life of the mind, the poetic process, and the beautifully and poignantly prosaic way our lives pass as a series of (mostly) ordinary days. The poems are soft-spoken and unassuming, each written as a component of Bly's morning ritual. "A Week of Poems at Bennington," for example, includes meditations on such lofty subjects as "The Dog's Ears" and "What the Buttocks Think." At the same time, the poems often address weighty matters: aging, friendship, and death. It is one of Bly's poetic virtues that he is able to write about such subjects (following the example of William Stafford) with a delicate and unpretentious touch. Consider the homespun phrasing and deeply felt acceptance of life's twists and turns in "The Resemblance Between Your Life and a Dog": I never intended to have this life, believe me-- / it just happened. You know how dogs turn up / At a farm, and they wag but can't explain. / It's good if you can accept your life..."Robert Bly's new work creates a sort of poem full of humor that readers have never seen from him before. Often personal and autobiographical, the poems in this collection include meditations on the art of poetry ("Rereading Silence in the Snowy Fields"), on Bly's boyhood on a Minnesota farm ("What the Animals Paid"), on myths and stories that shape our mutual world ("We're All in This Story"), as well as a sequence of poems on Wallace Stevens and meditations on aging and facing death. Written in the discipline of a poem each day, the poems have some of the freshness of morning in them. <p> <i>The Morning Poems</i> is Bly at his best, an important reminder of why he is one of America's most widely read and intensely admired poets. </p><p> Excerpt from "Loving God in the Kitchen Pans": </p><p> A lamp pours light into the room, and it is your </p><p> Room, as you write poems there.

My whole family is Muslim, and my society and culture were Muslim. . . . Changing from Islam to Christianity would mess up my life forever.So writes Abu Atallah, who grew up in Cairo as an ordinary Egyptian Muslim. He was deeply embedded in his family, religion, and country. For a time he was part of the Muslim Brotherhood. But as he came of age, he began to encounter people who followed a different way, who called themselves Christians. And a radically new life became possible?at great cost and risk, yet with great joy.From Cairo to Christ is the remarkable story of how one Muslim man was drawn to the Christian faith, and how he later became an ambassador for Christ with a ministry in the Muslim world. Atallah has personally helped hundreds of Muslims come to Christ.</p><p>Abu Atallah is the founder and CEO of European Training Centre and a pastor, professor, and missionary with the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. He was born and raised in Egypt, and after his conversion was involved with Campus Crusade at Cairo University. In 1979 he came to the United States, where he attended the Urbana missions conference and heard God?s call to minister to his people. He founded the Arab American Friendship Center in Dearborn, Michigan, and was a consultant and trainer for Arab World Ministries in London and across Europe. He has ministered in fifty-six countries on six continents. He has a master of divinity from Calvin Theological Seminary."<em>From Cairo to Christ</em> explores the difficulties Muslim converts face as they convert to Christ. Author Abu Atallah is an Egyptian who writes as an insider who became a believer decades ago. Those unacquainted with Islamic beliefs and practices will appreciate this easy-to-read primer." (Phil Parshall, SIM USA, author of The Cross and the Crescent)<br><br>"This book offers a uniquely personal account of the complex and challenging journey of many who convert from Islam to Christianity. The story of Abu 'Stephen' Atallah&#x2015;told with the help of his friend and coauthor Kent Van Til&#x2015;is especially timely as the West struggles to meet the needs of massive numbers of Arab refugees fleeing chaos and civil war in their home countries. The authors see this humanitarian crisis as an opportunity for Christians to share the love of Christ." (John C. Knapp, president and professor, Hope College)<br><br>"Abu Atallah is the real thing. I know because I am his colleague in the greatest rescue operation of our day: introducing 1.7 billion Muslims to the Savior. He could easily obtain an enviable position as a senior pastor in an American church, but like very few other Muslim-background believers, he and his dear wife have given themselves day and night to rescuing those who would like to assassinate him. This very humble, grateful account of his story is so real it's difficult to put down." (Greg Livingstone, founder, Frontiers, senior associate, World Outreach of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church)<br><br>"Your heart will be stirred as Abu recounts the journey that he has been on, both prior to knowing Jesus personally and then as a fully devoted follower of Christ. His life and testimony have richly blessed my own walk with Christ. This book will cause you to consider your own commitment to the cause of Christ." (Dave Gibson, pastor of missions and evangelism, Grace Church, Eden Prairie, Minnesota)<br><br>"This book is a must-read for anyone involved with Muslims and Muslim-background believers in the United States or overseas. The authors speak authentically, honestly, and truthfully. Through their words, you'll come to a deeper understanding of the culture and religious perspectives of Arab Muslims and the heart-level experiences of individuals as their faith journeys intersect with Christ and with our Western secular and Christian cultures." (Kate McCord, author of In the Land of Blue Burqas)<br><br>"With enthusiasm I recommend this welcome narrative of the life of a friend who has made a journey of faith from following a prophet to embracing a faith different from the one he inherited. Academics, theologians, students, and church laity will all benefit from understanding the inside challenge of what it means to 'transfer your primary citizenship' from your own cultural context to a new commitment that reflects Matthew 6:33: 'Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness' (KJV)." (Ray Tallman, OC International)<br><br>"<em>From Cairo to Christ</em> is both a compelling first-person narrative of one Egyptian Muslim's journey to Christ and into fruitful Christian ministry among Muslims globally and also a helpful analysis of Islam and Muslims in our twenty-first-century world. Abu Atallah doesn't downplay profoundly disturbing aspects of Islam, nor does he hesitate in critiquing some embarrassing negative Christian attitudes toward Muslims. Atallah's often painful journey helpfully illuminates typical experiences for believers out of Islam as they seek to live their lives in faithfulness to their new Lord in Muslim communities, both in the Muslim world and here in the West. This short book provides invaluable perspective into the experience of those who follow Christ out of Islam as well as penetrating insights into the beliefs and experiences of Muslims in the Arab world and America today. I warmly commend it to those who desire to better understand and befriend both their Muslim neighbor and their Christian friend who was once a Muslim." (Don Little, missiologist, Pioneers, director, The Lilias Trotter Center, author of Effective Discipling in Muslim Communities)<br><br>"<em>From Cairo to Christ</em> takes the reader through an insightful, informative, and provocative journey exploring the on-the-ground realities of the Muslim faith from the perspective of a Muslim convert to Christianity. The challenges encountered and dealt with by Abu Atallah provide fresh insights into understanding how Christians can better relate to Muslims today, in our context of religious pluralism. This book also serves as a mirror for Western Christians to more carefully critique their own understanding and practices of Christianity." (Craig Van Gelder, emeritus professor of congregational mission, Luther Seminary)<br><br>"From Cairo to Christ is at once a primer on Arabic culture, a comparison between Christianity and Islam, and a history lesson in the making. He provides a bridge for greater understanding between cultures as he points others to the Prince of Peace. Atallah serves as a most credible teacher, having walked a mile in both sets of shoes." (Von Mitchell, Christian Market, July 2017)<br><br>"<em>From Cairo to Christ</em> inspires, informs and compels readers for the great privilege of relating Jesus to Muslims&#x2015;in loving, living proclamation&#x2015;wherever they are."

It was dawn, which meant, in the Labyrinth, nothing more than a graying of night's black. But this dawn was different than most. It was more glorious than most . . . and more terrifying. It was brightened by hope, darkened by fear<br><br>It was a dawn which saw the city of Abri, in the very center of the Labyrinth, still standing, victorious, after a terrible battle with its most implacable enemies.<br><br>It was a dawn smudged with the smoke of funeral pyres; a dawn in which the living could draw a tremulous breath and dare to hope life might be better.<br><br>It was a dawn lit by a lurid red glow on the far distant horizon, a red glow that was brightening, strengthening. Those Patryns who guarded the city walls turned their eyes to that strange and unnatural glow, shook their heads, spoke of it in low and ominous tones.<br><br>"It bodes nothing good," they said grimly.<br><br>Who could blame them for their dark outlook? Not Vasu. Certainly not Vasu, who knew what was transpiring. He would have to tell them soon, destroy the joy of this dawning.<br><br>"That glow is the fire of battle," he would have to say to his people. "A battle raging for control of the Final Gate. The dragon-snakes who attacked us were not defeated, as you thought. Yes, we killed four of them. But for every four that die, eight are born. Now they are attacking the Final Gate, seeking to shut it, seeking to trap us all in this dread prison.<br><br>"Our brothers, those who live in the Nexus and those near the Final Gate, are fighting this evil--so we have reason to believe. But they are few in number and the evil is vast and powerful.<br><br>"We are too far away to come to their aid. Too far. By the time we reached them--if we ever did reach them, alive--it would be too late. It may already be too late.<br><br>"And when the Final Gate is shut, the evil in the Labyrinth will grow strong. Our fear and our hatred will grow stronger to match and the evil will feed off that fear and that hatred and grow stronger still."<br><br>It is hopeless, Vasu told himself, and so he must tell the people. Logic, reason said to him it was hopeless. Yet why, standing on the wall, staring at that red glow in the sky, did he feel hopeful?<br><br>It made no sense. He sighed and shook his head.<br><br>A hand touched his arm.<br><br>"Look, Headman. They have made it safely to the river."<br><br>One of the Patryns, standing beside Vasu, had obviously mistaken his sigh, thought it indicated fear for the two who had left the city in the dark hour before the dawn. They were embarking on a dangerous and probably futile search for the green and golden dragon who had fought for them in the<b> </b>skies above Abri. The green and golden dragon was the<b> </b>Serpent Mage, who was also the bumbling Sartan with the mensch name, Alfred.<br><br>Certainly Vasu was afraid for them, but he was also hopeful for them. That same illogical, irrational hope.<br><br>Vasu was not a man of action. He was a man of thought, of imagination. He had only to look at his soft and pudgy Sartan body, tattooed with Patryn runes, to know that. He must give thought to what his people should do next. He should make plans, he should decide how they must prepare for the inevitable. He should tell them the truth, give his speech of despair.<br><br>But he didn't do any of that. He stood on the walls, watching the mensch known as Hugh the Hand and the Patryn woman Marit.<br><br>He told himself he would never see them again. They were venturing out into the Labyrinth, dangerous at any time but doubly dangerous now that their defeated enemies skulked about in anger and waited for revenge. The two were going on a foolhardy and hopeless mission. He would never see them again, nor Alfred, the Serpent Mage, the green and golden dragon, for whom they searched.<br><br>Vasu stood on the wall and waited--hopefully--for their return.<br>The River of Anger, which flowed beneath the city walls of Abri, was frozen. Its water had been frozen by their enemies, by spells cast on it. The hideous dragonsnakes had turned the river to ice in order that their troops could cross more easily.<br><br>Clambering down the rock-strewn sides of the riverbank, Marit smiled grimly. The tactics of her enemy would serve her.<br><br>There was just one small problem.<br><br>"You say this was done by magic?" Hugh the Hand, sliding down the bank behind her, skidded to a halt beside the black ice floe. He jabbed at it with the toe of his boot. "How long will the spell last?"<br><br>That was the problem.<br><br>"I don't know," Marit was forced to admit.<br><br>"Yeah." Hugh grunted. "I thought as much. It might end when we're standing in the middle."<br><br>"It might." Marit shrugged. If that happened, they would be lost. The rushing black water would suck them down, chill their blood, grind their bodies against the sharp rocks, fill their lungs with the black and now blood-tinged water.<br><br>"There's no other way?" Hugh the Hand was looking at her, at the blue sigla tattooed on her body.<br><br>He meant, of course, her magic.<br><br>"I might be able to get myself across," she told him. Then again, she might not. She was weakened in body from yesterday's battle, weakened in her spirit from yesterday's confrontation with Lord Xar. "But I'd never be able to manage you."<br><br>She set foot on the ice, felt its cold strike through to the very marrow of her bones. Clamping her teeth together to keep them from chattering, she stared at the far shore and said, "Only a short run. It won't take us long."<br><br>Hugh the Hand said nothing. He was staring--not at the shore, but at the ice.<br><br>And then Marit remembered. This man, a professional assassin, afraid of nothing in his world, had come across something in another world he did fear--water.<br><br>"What are you scared of?" Marit jeered, hoping to bolster his courage by shaming him. "You can't die."<br><br><i>"I can </i>die," he corrected her. "I just don't stay dead. And, lady, I don't mind telling you, this sort of dying doesn't appeal to me."<br><br>"It doesn't appeal to me either," she said snappishly<br><br>back at him, but she noticed she wasn't going anywhere, had hurriedly snatched her foot back off the ice.<br><br>She drew in a deep breath. "You can follow or not, as you please."<br><br>"I'm of little use to you anyway," he said bitterly, hands clenching and unclenching. "I can't protect you, defend you. I can't even protect or defend myself"<br><br>He couldn't be killed. He couldn't kill. Every arrow he fired missed its mark, every blow he aimed fell short, every slash of his sword went wide.<br><br>"I can defend myself," Marit answered. "I can defend you, too, for that matter. I need you because you know Alfred better than I do--"<br><br>"No, I don't," Hugh returned. "I don't think anyone knew Alfred. Not even Alfred knew Alfred. Haplo did, maybe, but that's not much help to us now."<br><br>Marit said nothing, bit her lip.<br><br>"But you're right to remind me, lady," Hugh the Hand continued. "If I don't find Alfred, this curse on me will never end. Come on. Let's get it over with."<br><br>He set foot on the ice, began to walk across it. His swift and impetuous move took Marit by surprise. She was hurrying after him before she quite knew what she was doing.<br><br>The ice was slippery and treacherous. The bonenumbing cold shot through her; she began shivering uncontrollably. She and Hugh clung to each other for support, his arm saving her from more than one sliding fall, her arm steadying him.<br><br>Halfway across, an eardrum-shattering crack split the ice, almost beneath their feet. A fur-covered clawed hand and arm shot up from the gurgling water, tried to grab hold of Marit. She grappled for the hilt of her sword.<br><br>Hugh the Hand stopped her.<br><br>"It's only a corpse," he said.<br><br>Marit, looking more closely, saw he was right. The arm was flaccid, sucked down by the current almost immediately.<br><br>"The spell's ending," she said, irritated at herself "We have to hurry."<br><br>She continued across. But a thin layer of water was now seeping over the ice, making it even more slippery. Her feet slid out from underneath her. She grabbed at Hugh, but he, too, had lost his footing. They both fell. Landing on her hands and knees, she stared into the horribly grinning mouth and bulging eyes of a dead wolfen.<br><br>The black ice split right between her hands. The wolfen popped out, lunged straight at her. Involuntarily, Marit shrank backward. Hugh the Hand caught hold of her.<br><br>"The ice is breaking apart," he yelled. "Hurry!"<br><br>They were at least two body lengths from the shoreline.<br><br>Marit scrambled toward the shore, crawling since she could not stand. Her arms and legs ached with the cold; the pain was intense. Hugh the Hand slithered along beside her. His face was livid, his jaw clenched so tight it resembled the ice. His eyes were wide and staring. For him--born and raised Oh a waterless world-- drowning was the worst possible death imaginable. Terror had very nearly robbed him of his senses.<br><br>They were close to the bank, close to safety.<br><br>The Labyrinth was intelligent evil, cunning malevolence. It permitted you to hope, let you imagine that you could make it to safety.<br><br>Marit's numb hand clutched at a large rock, one of several lining the riverbank. She struggled to grip it with unfeeling fingers, pull herself up.<br><br>The ice gave way beneath her. She plunged to her waist in frothing black water. Her hand slid off the rock. The current was carrying her down . . .<br><br>A terrific boost from strong arms propelled Marit up and onto the bank. She landed hard, the breath knocked from her body. She lay, gasping, until a gurgle and a wild yell caused her to turn around.<br><br>Standing precariously on an ice floe, Hugh clung with one hand to the trunk of a scrub tree growing out of the bank. He had thrown her to safety, then managed to grab hold of the tree.<br><br>But the rushing water was tearing the ice floe out from under him. The current was strong. His tenuous hold on the tree was slipping.<br><br>Marit flung herself bodily on Hugh just as he lost his grasp. Her numb fingers clutching at the back of his leather vest, she fought to pull him from the river. She was on her knees; the water was rising. If she failed, they would both go under. Desperately she held on to his vest, pulled it up nearly over his head. Digging her knees into the mud, she dragged the man's heavy body backward. Hugh was strong; he gave her what help he could. He kicked with his feet, sought purchase with his flailing legs, and, finally, managed to squirm his way onto the bank.<br><br>He lay still, gasping and shivering with cold and terror. Hearing a rumbling sound, Marit looked upriver. A wall of black water tinged with red foam, pushing huge chunks of ice in its path, thundered downstream.<br><br>"Hugh!" she cried.<br><br>He raised his head, saw the rushing floodwaters. He staggered to his feet, began scrambling up the bank. Marit was past helping him; she could barely make it herself She collapsed onto firm, level ground; was dimly aware of Hugh the Hand falling somewhere near her.<br><br>The river roared in rage at losing its prey; or perhaps that was only her imagination. She stilled her rapid breathing, calmed the wild beating of her heart. Letting the rune-magic warm her, she banished the terrible cold.<br><br>But she couldn't lie here long. The enemy-- chaodyn, wolfen, tiger-men--must be hiding in the woods, perhaps watching them even now. She glanced at the sigla tattooed on her skin; the glow of the runes would warn her of approaching danger. Her skin was slightly blue, but that was with cold. The sigla were dark.<br><br>This should have been reassuring, but it wasn't. It was illogical. Certainly some of those who had attacked the city with such fury yesterday must still be lurking outside the city walls, waiting for a chance to pick off a scouting party.<br><br>But the runes did not glimmer, except perhaps very, very faintly. If any of the enemy were about, they were far away and not interested. Marit couldn't understand it and she didn't like it. This uncanny absence of the foe frightened her more than the sight of a pack of wolfen.<br><br>Hope. When the Labyrinth offers you hope, it means that it is just about to snatch that hope away.<br><br>She pushed herself to a crouching position, alert and wary. Hugh the Hand lay huddled on the ground. He was shivering uncontrollably, his body racked by chills. His lips were blue, his teeth chattering so violently he'd bitten his tongue. Blood dribbled from his mouth.<br><br>Marit didn't know much about mensch. Could he die of the cold? Perhaps not, but he might fall sick, slow her up. Moving about, walking, would warm his blood, but she had to get him on his feet first. She recalled hearing from Haplo that rune-magic would work to heal mensch. Crawling over to Hugh, she clasped her hands over his wrists, let the magic flow from her body to his.<br><br>His shaking ceased. Slowly, a tinge of color returned to his pallid face. At length, he sighed, fell back on the ground, closed his eyes, letting the blissful warmth spread through his body.<br><br>"Don't fall asleep!" Marit warned.<br><br>Touching his tender tongue to his teeth, he groaned, grunted. "Back on Arianus, I used to dream that when I was a wealthy man, I'd wallow in water. Have a big barrel of it outside my house and I'd jump in it, splash it over my head. Now"--he grimaced--"may the ancestors take me if I so much as drink a sip of the cursed stuff!"<br><br>Marit stood up. "We can't stay here, out in the open like this. If you're feeling up to it, we have to move."<br><br>Hugh was on his feet immediately. "Why? What is it?"<br><br>He looked at the runes on her hands and arms; he'd been around Haplo long enough to know the signs. Seeing the sigla dark, he glanced up at her questioningly.<br><br>"I don't know," she answered, staring hard into the forest. "There's nothing close, seemingly. But. . ." Unable to explain her uneasiness, she shook her head.<br><br>"Which way?" Hugh asked.<br><br>Marit considered. Vasu had pointed out the site where the green and golden dragon--Alfred--had last been seen. That was to the gateward side of the city, the side facing the next gate.*&nbsp;&nbsp;She and Vasu had judged the distance to be within half a day's walk.<br><br>Marit gnawed her lip. She could enter the woods, which would give them shelter but would also make them more vulnerable to their enemies, who--if they were out there--were undoubtedly using the woods to conceal their own movements. Or she could keep to the riverbank, keep in view of the ciq. For a short distance, any foe who attacked her would be in range of the magical weapons held by the guards on the ciq walls.<br><br>Marit decided to stay near the river, at least until the ciq could offer no more protection. Perhaps by then she would have picked up a trail that would lead her to Alfred.<br><br>What that trail might be, she didn't like to think.<br><br>She and Hugh moved cautiously along the river's shoreline. The black water churned and fumed in its banks, brooding over the indignities it had suffered. The two took care to keep clear of the slippery bank on one side and avoid the forest shadows on the other.<br><br>The woods were silent, strangely silent. It was as if every living being had gone away . . .<br><br>Marit halted, sick witThousands of pages have been spent getting to this seventh and final book in the massive Death Gate Cycle (Into the Labyrinth). Only the most voracious fans of Weis and Hickman will feel it was worth the effort; anyone else will find that incomprehensible (and poorly sketched) landscapes and tedious prose make this volume both dizzying and dull. Here, Marit (a sorceress), Hugh the Hand, Alfred the Sartan and Haplo the Patryn join forces to stop various nefarious (or at least misguided and misunderstood) villains as they try to subjugate each other's races, get to Death's Gate and destroy the world as they know it. A significant portion of the more interesting lore and stories (of elves who imprison their souls in ornate boxes, etc.), however, gets little more than footnotes, an epilogue or a short mention in the appendices. While these addenda seem an attempt to add literary flavor to this hodgepodge of zombies, sorcerors, dragons and a schizophrenically postmodern God who occasionally thinks he's James Bond, they succeed only in upping the page count. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Overgrown: Practices between Landscape Architecture and Gardening (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A call for landscape architects to leave the office and return to the garden.</b></p><p>Addressing one of the most repressed subjects in landscape architecture, this book could only have been written by someone who is both an experienced gardener and a landscape architect. With <i>Overgrown</i>, Julian Raxworthy offers a watershed work in the tradition of Ian McHarg, Anne Whiston Spirn, Kevin Lynch, and J. B. Jackson. </p><p>As a discipline, landscape architecture has distanced itself from gardening, and landscape architects take pains to distinguish themselves from gardeners or landscapers. Landscape architects tend to imagine gardens from the office, representing plants with drawings or other simulations, whereas gardeners work in the dirt, in real time, planting, pruning, and maintaining. In <i>Overgrown</i>, Raxworthy calls for the integration of landscape architecture and gardening. Each has something to offer the other: Landscape architecture can design beautiful spaces, and gardening can enhance and deepen the beauty of garden environments over time. Growth, says Raxworthy, is the medium of garden development; landscape architects should leave the office and go into the garden in order to know growth in an organic, nonsimulated way. </p><p>Raxworthy proposes a new practice for working with plant material that he terms &#x201c;the viridic&#x201d; (after &#x201c;the tectonic&#x201d; in architecture), from the Latin word for green, with its associations of spring and growth. He builds his argument for the viridic through six generously illustrated case studies of gardens that range from &#x201c;formal&#x201d; to &#x201c;informal&#x201d; approaches&#x2015;from a sixteenth-century French Renaissance water garden to a Scottish poet-scientist's &#x201c;marginal&#x201d; garden, barely differentiated from nature. Raxworthy argues that landscape architectural practice itself needs to be &#x201c;gardened,&#x201d; brought back into the field. He offers a &#x201c;Manifesto for the Viridic&#x201d; that casts designers and plants as vegetal partners in a renewed practice of landscape gardening.</p></p><p>Julian Raxworthy is a landscape architect living in Dubai. He is an Honorary Associate Professor with the School of Architecture at the University of Queensland, Australia.<p><i>Overgrown</i>&nbsp;is a compelling and visually engaging testament that gardens and gardening informed by horticulture and design are central activities of landscape architecture.

Eric is the Discworld&#39;s only demonology hacker. The trouble is, he&#39;s not very good at it. All he wants is the usual three wishes: to be immortal, rule the world and have the most beautiful woman fall madly in love with him. The usual stuff. But what he gets is Rincewind, the Disc&#39;s most incompetent wizard, and Rincewind&#39;s Luggage (the world&#39;s most dangerous travel accessory) into the bargain. The outcome is an outrageous adventure that will leave Eric wishing once more - this time, quite fervently - that he&#39;d never been born.</p><p>Terry Pratchett (Author) Sir Terry Pratchett is a publishing phenomenon. Among his many prizes and citations are the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award, the Carnegie Medal, the BSFA Award, eight honorary doctorates and, of course, a knighthood.

After attending school in Calcutta, Benny settles in Rangoon, then part of the British Empire, and falls in love with Khin, a woman who is part of a long-persecuted ethnic minority group, the Karen. World War II comes to Southeast Asia, and Benny and Khin must go into hiding in the eastern part of the country during the Japanese Occupation, beginning a journey that will lead them to change the country&#x2019;s history. After the war, the British authorities make a deal with the Burman nationalists, led by Aung San, whose party gains control of the country. When Aung San is assassinated, his successor ignores the pleas for self-government of the Karen people and other ethnic groups, and in doing so sets off what will become the longest-running civil war in recorded history. Benny and Khin&#x2019;s eldest child, Louisa, has a danger-filled, tempestuous childhood and reaches prominence as Burma&#x2019;s first beauty queen soon before the country falls to dictatorship. As Louisa navigates her newfound fame, she is forced to reckon with her family&#x2019;s past, the West&#x2019;s ongoing covert dealings in her country, and her own loyalty to the cause of the Karen people.<br> <br> Based on the story of the author&#x2019;s mother and grandparents, <i>Miss Burma</i> is a captivating portrait of how modern Burma came to be and of the ordinary people swept up in the struggle for self-determination and freedom.</p><p><b>Charmaine Craig</b>&#x2019;s first novel, <i>The Good Men</i> (Riverhead), was a national bestseller translated into six languages.

A former actor in film and television, she studied literature at Harvard University and lives in Los Angeles with her husband and daughters.There she is, Louisa at fifteen, stepping onto a makeshift stage at the center of Rangoon&#x2019;s Aung San Stadium in 1956. <i>Give yourself to them</i>, she thinks. And immediately one hand goes to her hip, her head tilts upward, her awareness descends to her exposed thighs, to her too muscular calves, now in plain view of the forty thousand spectators seated in the darkening stands.<br> <br> <i>Give them what they need</i>, her mother told her. And Louisa understands that her mother meant more than a view of her gold highheeled sandals (on loan from a friend and pinching her toes), more than the curves accentuated by her white one-piece (copied from a photo of Elizabeth Taylor). Her mother meant something like a vision of hope. Yet what is Louisa&#x2019;s appearance on this garish stage, during the final round of the Miss Burma contest, but a picture of something dangerous. She is approximately naked, her gleaming suit approximately concealing what should be private. She is approximately innocent, pushing a hip to one side, close to plummeting into indignity.<br> <br> A tide of applause draws her farther into the light. She pivots, presenting the judges and the spectators beyond them with a view of her behind (ample thanks to her Jewish father, who sits with her mother somewhere in the stands nearby). Before her now are the other finalists, nine of them, grouped in the shadows upstage. Their smiles are fixed, their eyes gleaming with outrage. &#x201c;The special contender,&#x201d; the government paper recently called her. How strange to be dubbed &#x201c;the image of unity and integration&#x201d; when she has wanted only to go unremarked&#x2015;she, the mixed-breed, who is embarrassed by mentions of beauty and race. &#x201c;We never win the games we mean to,&#x201d; her father once told her.</p><h2>Why Is That in Tradition?</h2><p>The author of Where Is That in the Bible? tackles the other half of the divine revelation.

Two of the fleet&#x2019;s special mission vessels, the <i>U.S.S. Galen </i>and <i>U.S.S. Demeter, </i>are left at New Talax to aid Neelix&#x2019;s people, while the <i>Voyager</i>, <i>Quirinal</i>, <i>Esquiline</i>, <i>Hawking</i>, and <i>Curie </i>do a systematic search for any remnants of the Borg or Caeliar, even as the <i>Achilles </i>moves to a location central enough to offer aid to the exploring vessels as needed. As this critical mission begins, Fleet Commander Afsarah Eden, who has shared what little she knows of her mysterious past with Captain Chakotay, begins to experience several more &#x201c;awakenings&#x201d; as she encounters artifacts and places that make her feel connected to her long-lost home. She is reluctant to allow these visions to overshadow the mission, and this becomes increasingly difficult as time passes. But in the midst of this growing crisis, no one in the fleet could anticipate the unexpected return of one of Starfleet&#x2019;s most revered leaders&#x2014;a return that could hold the very fate of the galaxy in the balance.</p><p>Kirsten Beyer is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of many <i>Star Trek: Voyager </i>novels, including <i>A Pocket Full of Lies,</i><i> Acts of Contrition, Protectors, The Eternal Tide, Children of the Storm, Unworthy, Full Circle, </i>and<i> String Theory: Fusion.</i> She is also an actor for theater, movies, television, and commercials. She lives with her family in Los Angeles.Star Trek: Voyager: The Eternal Tide Chapter One<p></p> <br>VOYAGER<br> <br>Captain Afsarah Eden couldn&#x2019;t tear her eyes away from the viewscreen. Voyager moved at maximum warp, the deck below Eden&#x2019;s boots thrumming with the engines&#x2019; strain as stars stretched themselves out in the illusory image that defined this particular version of warp flight.<br> <br>Eden and her crew were fleeing certain death. And with each second that passed, oblivion was gaining on them. The ship could not maintain its current velocity indefinitely, nor could it safely form a slipstream tunnel to increase its odds of outrunning destruction.<br> <br>Part of Eden knew that by running, they were only prolonging the inevitable. In some cold, lonely corner of her heart, she had already accepted her own death. But the duty that had bound her to Starfleet and sustained her through the most difficult times of her life demanded that she make this attempt on behalf of those she led.<br> <br>The temptation, no, the desperate longing she felt to order the ship to come about was becoming more difficult to ignore. Did she need to see the beast, to name it before it devoured them? Was it some absurd definition of honor that called on her to stand her ground, even in the face of annihilation?<br> <br>Or was it simply the fact that she was tired of running? This monster had already taken too much from her. There was no longer any true victory to be claimed here. She was not fleeing a predator that might grow weary of its chase. She was attempting to outrun something that had all but stripped away every last shred of her own identity. She was incapable of resisting or defying it. It would have her. And given enough time, it might actually bring her to accept that its version of Afsarah Eden was truer than the one she had constructed in fifty-plus years of life.<br> <br>She belonged to this darkness, and as that certainty struck her with the force of a roaring wave, she began to lose her bearings. Her head grew inexplicably light and her knees buckled. Eden reached her right arm back to steady herself against the command chair in which she knew she would never again sit.<br> <br>Her eyes briefly registered another person standing beside her, and the motion meant to reorient her became a graceless stagger as she unconsciously rebelled against the sight her mind refused to accept.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m dead already.<br> <br>She had to be.<br> <br>Eden willed the vision to clear, but the longer she stared open-mouthed at the figure next to her, the more that figure seemed to coalesce and solidify.<br> <br>&#x201c;Impossible,&#x201d; Eden whispered.<br> <br>Beside her, Admiral Kathryn Janeway&#x2019;s stone-cold eyes held Eden&#x2019;s with a painful mixture of determined despair.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is a dream,&#x201d; Eden said, willing her voice to hold steady even as her senses scrambled for an escape route.<br> <br>&#x201c;Feels more like a nightmare to me,&#x201d; Kathryn replied.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The mess hall was all but deserted this close to the middle of gamma shift. Most of the crew members who had signed off a few hours earlier had already eaten, and those looking to get a jump on their day prior to the start of alpha shift wouldn&#x2019;t start straggling in for another hour at least.<br> <br>Still, Captain Chakotay didn&#x2019;t look up from his padd until the individual who had entered moments earlier made her way toward him and stood silently for a few seconds behind the chair across from his.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought you were planning to turn in early for a really good night&#x2019;s sleep,&#x201d; the weary voice of the fleet commander greeted him.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I thought the wee hours were the only ones that ever found you sleeping,&#x201d; he replied convivially as Captain Eden pulled out the chair and sat restlessly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you mind?&#x201d; she asked once the deed was already done.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; he replied sincerely. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to finish this letter tonight anyway,&#x201d; he added, stifling a yawn as he pushed the padd aside and sipped from a cup of tea that had grown cold an hour ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s unusual to find you at a loss for words,&#x201d; Eden said lightly as she rubbed her eyes.<br> <br>A faint smile traipsed across Chakotay&#x2019;s lips as he replied, &#x201c;Is that a good thing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So far I&#x2019;d say, absolutely,&#x201d; Eden said more seriously.<br> <br>A few months earlier, before the fleet had crossed paths with the Children of the Storm, Chakotay would have been hard-pressed to imagine himself engaged in such easy banter with Eden. Though she was a distinguished officer and an able leader, he&#x2019;d found it difficult to warm to her, probably in no small part due to the fact that Starfleet Command had seen fit to assign her to Voyager&#x2019;s center seat when the fleet had first launched and he was still deemed unfit for duty. Once Eden had assumed command of the fleet and officially requested that Chakotay resume his former place as Voyager&#x2019;s captain, she had continued to maintain an aloof distance from those she led.<br> <br>Recent, near disastrous events, however, had begun to bridge the distance between them, as they were forced to stretch the boundaries of the formal command structure and work together to find solutions to a vast array of challenges, including the loss of one of the nine ships that had originally begun the journey, the almost total loss of a second, and the capture of a third by the Children. Eden had also recently seen fit to share some of her personal history with him, including her mysterious origins, and he&#x2019;d finally begun to see her not just as his commanding officer, but as an individual: complex, devoted to duty, but painfully alone. Now, he found that he had no compunction in returning her confidence and was actually grateful for the opportunity to share a little of his own current burden.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my sister, Sekaya,&#x201d; he sighed.<br> <br>Eden&#x2019;s eyes left his as she searched her memory. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not Starfleet, is she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. She has accepted civilian assignments from time to time, but where I&#x2019;ve seen the possibility of working for positive change from within Starfleet, she&#x2019;s always been skeptical.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eden nodded. &#x201c;Your people&#x2019;s experiences with the Cardassians probably had something to do with that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For starters,&#x201d; Chakotay agreed.<br> <br>Suddenly Eden&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;She thought your resignation was going to be permanent, didn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t the only one,&#x201d; Chakotay chuckled. &#x201c;Of course I wrote to her the moment I reassumed command of Voyager, but I didn&#x2019;t get her response until we regrouped with the rest of the fleet last week.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not happy,&#x201d; Eden rightly surmised.<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>What began as a slight pause was threatening to stretch into a lull when Chakotay added, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t blame her. She never saw what Kathryn&#x2019;s death did to me, but we have enough mutual friends that word got back to her anyway. Her relief at my resignation was comforting at the time, but I&#x2019;m finding it harder now to explain my certainty that as much as leaving the service, even briefly, was absolutely necessary, returning now is the best choice I could possibly make.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you doubt your choice?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; Chakotay replied firmly. &#x201c;I know I haven&#x2019;t &#x2018;taken a step back or retreated from a better future.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>Eden&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t mince words, does she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It runs in the family.&#x201d; Chakotay grinned knowingly. &#x201c;But beyond assuring her that she&#x2019;s wrong, and without actually being able to see her and explain myself in person, I don&#x2019;t know how to convince her. The more I think about it, the more I realize that my choice has more to do with instinct or . . . a feeling I trust but can&#x2019;t really name. I&#x2019;ve made peace with my past.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eden shook her head and smiled mirthlessly. &#x201c;That makes one of us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Setting his own concerns aside, Chakotay took a moment to study Eden. Tension knotted her brow and lifted her shoulders. Her black, almond-shaped eyes were uncharacteristically uncertain.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, why aren&#x2019;t you sleeping tonight, Afsarah?&#x201d; he asked kindly.<br> <br>She sat back in her chair and took a long sip of whatever warm beverage she&#x2019;d replicated before joining him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I doubt that.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was pleased to see her countenance soften just enough to let a little light back into her eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;For the last few weeks, I&#x2019;ve been having this recurring dream.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; he asked, genuinely intrigued. Though he was no expert in dream analysis, it, like all manner of subconscious exploration, had been a subject of deep inquiry throughout his life. His curiosity was grounded in his people&#x2019;s unquestioning acceptance of a spiritual realm that coexisted with reality and could be entered willingly with enough practice. But this belief was rare among Starfleet officers&#x2014;so rigorously grounded in reason, logic, and science.<br> <br>Eden took another sip before going on. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m alone on the bridge. At least at first.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chakotay kept his expression neutral as he nodded for her to continue.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re moving at high warp away from something terrible. We need to go faster, but we can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m absolutely certain the ship is about to be destroyed. And then . . .&#x201d; Her voice trailed off.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t be bothering you with this.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chakotay was puzzled by her abrupt retreat. &#x201c;Then?&#x201d; he gently coaxed.<br> <br>Eden studied his face and in a brief instant, Chakotay saw that her concern was not that she would be embarrassed but that somehow she would insult him.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a dream, Afsarah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the last one who would take anything you say personally.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eden sighed and dropped her chin in deference to his perceptiveness. Shrugging slightly, she went on, &#x201c;And then I look to my right and Kathryn Janeway is standing beside me. I know in some ways that should make me feel better. I mean, whom would you rather have beside you in a fight? But the sight of her absolutely terrifies me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chakotay lowered his head for a moment to hide the wide smile that erupted on his face at this revelation. Suddenly Eden&#x2019;s discomfort was crystal clear. When he raised his eyes to hers again, he hoped they offered the compassion she deserved.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a captain&#x2019;s nightmare,&#x201d; he said, trying hard to compose himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;A what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A captain&#x2019;s nightmare. Most professions have their own version of it. Performers often dream that they&#x2019;re onstage in the middle of a production but don&#x2019;t know any of their lines. Musicians are trying to play a concert but their instruments won&#x2019;t stay in tune. Teachers arrive at their class, begin a lecture, and realize they are stark naked.&#x201d;<br> <br>The corners of Eden&#x2019;s full lips finally turned upward as he continued.<br> <br>&#x201c;And Starfleet captains find themselves facing certain death and the loss of their ships to unconquerable foes,&#x201d; he finished.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; Eden nodded, though not without reservation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Every captain I&#x2019;ve ever known has a version of it,&#x201d; Chakotay insisted.<br> <br>After a moment, Eden said hesitantly, &#x201c;And Admiral Janeway&#x2019;s presence?&#x201d;<br> <br>Chakotay felt his face fall into more serious lines. &#x201c;Kathryn is more strongly identified with Voyager than any other individual who has ever served her. When you first took command, you were stepping into legendary shoes. I&#x2019;d have been amazed if you didn&#x2019;t find that daunting, consciously and subconsciously.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you feel that way when you first took command of Voyager?&#x201d; Eden asked.<br> <br>Chakotay shook his head. &#x201c;It was different. I was already part of Voyager, and at least at first, I felt like I was merely picking up where Kathryn had left off.&#x201d; He considered his next words carefully, then decided this was no time to hold back. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;ve already told me you feel a certain amount of guilt about Kathryn&#x2019;s death; you used to believe that she wouldn&#x2019;t have died if you and Admiral Batiste hadn&#x2019;t pushed so hard to get this mission back to the Delta Quadrant approved. I don&#x2019;t agree. But it sounds to me like you&#x2019;ve got some unfinished business you need to find some way to put behind you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eden sat somberly for a moment as his words sank in. Finally she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chakotay sensed that she wasn&#x2019;t convinced, but he knew the words needed to be said, and might again, several times, before Afsarah actually accepted them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you given any thought to my other suggestion?&#x201d; he asked, wondering if her recent choice to share with him what little she knew of her past, as well as her belief that the answers to that mystery might lie in the Delta Quadrant, was partially responsible for increasing her general level of anxiety.<br> <br>Confusion flashed briefly across Eden&#x2019;s face before the light dawned. &#x201c;About seeing the Doctor?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Chakotay replied, unwilling to push too hard.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a perfectly reasonable suggestion,&#x201d; she acknowledged hesitantly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never shared my full history with any medical doctor who has evaluated me because, honestly, I didn&#x2019;t see the need. And you&#x2019;re right that he might be able to discover some physiological clue to my ancestry. I&#x2019;m just reluctant to waste resources on my personal agenda,&#x201d; she finally admitted. &#x201c;As I told Hugh, I&#x2019;m more than content to allow this mystery to unfold in its own time. I don&#x2019;t need to hurry it along.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chakotay considered her qualms, then said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see it as wasting resources, and I&#x2019;m certain neither did the counselor. To seek answers to a question that is clearly troubling you is not to attempt to commandeer the fleet&#x2019;s many tools for your own personal gain. You&#x2019;re not Admiral Batiste, Afsarah.

And yet this ancient land and its varied societies experienced prolonged and intense interaction with the peoples and cultures of East and Southeast Asia, Europe, Africa, and especially Central Asia and the Iranian plateau.<br> &nbsp;<br> Richard M. Eaton tells this extraordinary story with relish and originality, as he traces the rise of Persianate culture, a many-faceted transregional world connected by ever-widening networks across much of Asia. Introduced to India in the eleventh century by dynasties based in eastern Afghanistan, this culture would become progressively indigenized in the time of the great Mughals (sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries). Eaton brilliantly elaborates the complex encounter between India's Sanskrit culture&#x2014;an equally rich and transregional complex that continued to flourish and grow throughout this period&#x2014;and Persian culture, which helped shape the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, and a host of regional states. This long-term process of cultural interaction is profoundly reflected in the languages, literatures, cuisines, attires, religions, styles of rulership and warfare, science, art, music, and architecture&#x2014;and more&#x2014;of South Asia.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Given his groundbreaking studies on the Deccan, Bengal, and the Punjab, Richard M.

It tells the story of why <i>all</i> human beings have the potential to be hideously cruel and destructive to one another. Why are we our own worst enemy? The book shows us that war has been with us---in one form or another---since prehistoric times, and looking at the behavior of our close relatives, the chimpanzees, it argues that a penchant for group violence has been bred into us over millions of years of biological evolution. <i>The Most Dangerous Animal </i>takes the reader on a journey through evolution, history, anthropology, and psychology, showing how and why the human mind has a dual nature: on the one hand, we are ferocious, dangerous animals who regularly commit terrible atrocities against our own kind, on the other, we have a deep aversion to killing, a horror of taking human life. Meticulously researched and far-reaching in scope and with examples taken from ancient and modern history, <i>The Most Dangerous Animal </i>delivers a sobering lesson for an increasingly dangerous world.</p></p><p><p>Dr. David Livingstone Smith is the author of <i>Why We Lie</i> as well as a professor of philosophy and cofounder and director of the Institute for Cognitive Science and Evolutionary Psychology at the University of New England.

Four men, masked and clothed in black, tensely clutched their automatic weapons while the bound and blindfolded Armstrong knelt in front of them. &#x201c;God&#x2019;s soldiers from Tawhid and Jihad were able to abduct three infidels of God&#x2019;s enemies in Baghdad,&#x201c; the leader intoned, &#x201c;... by the name of God, these three hostages will get nothing from us except their throats slit and necks chopped, so they will serve as an example.&#x201d; The long knife sliced through Armstrong&#x2019;s flesh. He screamed. Blood gushed from his neck. His body shuddered and became limp. The executioner placed the dripping, severed head on the back of Armstrong&#x2019;s lifeless body. Do you think that this is a shocking image? When the video was broadcast on national television, it was interrupted before any blood was spilled. Perhaps this discretion was a good thing; the image was, after all, very disturbing. But perhaps it would have been better to show it. Armstrong&#x2019;s execution was an act of war, and war is terrible. Like many terrible things, it is something that we do not want to think about too much if we can help it.Many people conceive of war in terms of manly, granite-chinned heroes duking it out with the forces of evil. The reality is very different from this comic-book picture. It is something from which we collectively avert our gaze. The news and entertainment media obligingly maintain our illusions, protecting our sensibilities from too potent a dose of reality. This is why, during the dark days of the Cambodian genocide, the Associated Press rejected photographs of a smiling soldier eating the liver of a Khmer Rouge fighter whom he had just gutted and a soldier lowering a human head by the hair into a pot of boiling water. And it is why U.S. newspapers avoided British photographer Kenneth Jarecke&#x2019;s photograph of the charred head of an Iraqi soldier who was among those burned alive on Mutla Ridge during the closing chapter of the First Gulf War.1 When the British journalist Martin Bell reported on the war in Bosnia, he quickly realized that he was expected to sacrifice reality to &#x201c;good taste.&#x201d; The version of the war presented to television audiences was, he remarked, &#x201c;about as close to reality as a Hollywood action movie,&#x201c; later remarking that &#x201c;in our desire not to offend and upset people, we were not only sanitizing war but even prettifying it.... But war is real and war is terrible. War is a bad taste business.&#x201d;2The cosmetic transformation of war is nothing new. Painters of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries denuded war of its horror, portraying soldiers with &#x201c;neatly-bandaged head-wounds&#x201d; and &#x201c;manly and heroic expressions.&#x201d; Much the same is true of popular literature. The literary misrepresentation of war is exemplified by the writings of Rudyard Kipling, who, despite having no combat experience himself, confidently portrayed war in ludicrously glowing terms. Kipling&#x2019;s romantic fantasies lured a generation of young men to their deaths in the trenches of World War I. With the advent of photography in the early nineteenth century, representations of war took on a new dimension of realism. But even the early photographers of the American Civil War, Spanish-American War, and World War I were not above manipulating things to suit their expectations. They dragged bodies into position before snapping them and passed off cleaned-up reenactments of military engagements as the genuine article.3The advent of moving pictures opened new vistas for dishonestly representing battle. Most filmmakers steer safely clear of the horror and degradation of war, and most film viewers have no direct experience to act as a corrective to the Hollywood version. Consequently, many of us have an extremely distorted picture of combat. A real battlefield is not much like the typical movie version. &#x201c;On the screen,&#x201c; writes General Sir John Hackett, &#x201c;there are particular conventions to be observed.&#x201d;Men blown up by high explosives in real war... are often torn apart quite hideously; in films there is a big bang and bodies, intact, fly through the air with the greatest of ease. If they are shot... they fall down like children in a game, to lie motionless. The most harrowing thing in real battle is that they usually don&#x2019;t lie still; only the lucky ones are killed outright.4Life imitates art, and the glorification of war in modern cinema has had serious consequences for the lives of its consumers. Amazingly, many young men chose to join the U.S. Marines during the Vietnam War under the influence of John Wayne films. In their minds, going to war was like being a character in a movie: good guys killing bad guys, cowboys killing Indians. In fact, during the first four months of 1968, sixty U.S. soldiers in Vietnam died trying to outdraw one another just as they had seen actors do in cowboy films.5Because of these and other compelling illusions about war, it is easy--in fact, all too easy--to regard the perpetrators of mass violence as depraved monsters or madmen. For example, George W. Bush proclaimed that he ordered the invasion of Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s regime because he &#x201c;was not about to leave the security of the American people in the hands of a madman.&#x201d; French president Jacques Chirac described Osama bin Laden as &#x201c;a raving madman,&#x201c; while British foreign secretary Jack Straw described Bin Laden as &#x201c;psychotic and paranoid.&#x201d;6What evidence was there that these people were insane? There is usually none at all. The psychologists who painstakingly sifted through data on the senior Nazi officers brought to justice in the Nuremberg trials found that &#x201c;high-ranking Nazi war criminals... participated in atrocities without having diagnosable impairments that would account for their actions.&#x201d;7 They were &#x201c;as diverse a group as one might find in our government today, or in the leadership of the PTA.&#x201d;8 If the Nazi leaders were not deranged, what about the rank and file who did Hitler&#x2019;s dirty work? What about the members of the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile killing units that committed atrocities like the mass killing at Babi Yar, where 33,000 Jews, as well as many gypsies and mental patients, were machine-gunned to death during two crisp autumn days in 1941? Do you think that these men must have been psychopaths or Nazi zealots? If so, you are wrong. There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that they were anything other than ordinary German citizens. &#x201c;The system and rhythm of mass extermination,&#x201c; observes journalist Heinz Hohne, &#x201c;were directed by... worthy family men.&#x201d; The men of the German Reserve Police Battalion 101, a killing squad in Poland who were involved in the shooting of at least 38,000 Jews and the deportation of a further 83,000 to the Treblinka death camp, were ordinary middle-aged family men without either military training or ideological indoctrination. &#x201c;The truth seems to be,&#x201c; writes social psychologist James Waller, &#x201c;that the most outstanding characteristic of perpetrators of extraordinary evil lies in their normality, not their abnormality.&#x201d;9 Purveyors of violence, terrorists, and merchants of genocidal destruction are, more often than not, people who fit the profile that Primo Levi painted of his Nazi jailers at Auschwitz: &#x201c;average human beings, averagely intelligent, averagely wicked... they had our faces.&#x201d; To Hannah Arendt they were &#x201c;terribly and terrifyingly normal.&#x201d;10 They could be your neighbors, parents, or children. They could be you.This book is about where war lives in human nature. It is not only, or even primarily, about people like Hitler, Stalin, or Saddam: It is about people like you and me, our ancestors, our children, and our children&#x2019;s children. It tells the story of why human beings, all human beings, have the potential to be hideously cruel and destructive to one another. Other animals attack and sometimes kill members of their own kind, but they do not organize themselves into groups to destroy neighboring communities. Mark Twain made this point over a century ago.Man is the only animal that deals in that atrocity of atrocities, war. He is the only one that gathers his brethren about him and goes forth in cold blood and calm pulse to exterminate his kind. He is the only animal that for sordid wages will march out... and help to slaughter strangers of his own species who have done him no harm and with whom he has no quarrel.... And in the intervals between campaigns he washes the blood off his hands and works for &#x201c;the universal brotherhood of man&#x201d;--with his mouth.11In fact, Twain&#x2019;s portrait of human nature is far too charitable. Men not only march out to slaughter their own kind on a scale so huge that it beggars the imagination, they often do so in ways that are diabolically cruel. A small taste of this side of human nature is conveyed in the following passage from Thomas Alfred Walker&#x2019;s classic History of the Law of Nations.When Basil II (1014) could blind fifteen thousand Bulgarians, leaving an eye to the leader of every hundred, it ceases to be a matter of surprise that Saracen marauders should thirty years later be impaled by Byzantine officials, that the Greeks of Adramyttium in the time of Malek Shah (1106-16) should drown Turkish children in boiling water, and that the Emperor Necephorus (961) should cast from catapults into a Cretan city the heads of Saracens slain in the attempt to raise the siege, or that a crusading Prince of Antioch (1097) should cook human bodies on spits to earn for his men the terrifying reputation of cannibalism.12Walker was writing about events that unfolded long ago and far away and that are safely confined to the pages of history books.

Working magick with the elements helps to connect us to the tangibly present natural powers in our physical world, whilst at the same time we are returning to the building blocks of magick by rooting our feet in the material world. Since Empedocles formalized the system in ancient Greece in the 5th century BCE, the four elements have become an integral part of the Western Esoteric Tradition &#x2013; passing from ancient Greek magick&nbsp;through the Qabalah &amp; Grimoire Traditions into modern derivative traditions of ceremonial magick and paganism.</p><p>In Practical Elemental Magick the authors provide an unprecedented combination of research and techniques for working the magick of Air, Fire, Water and Earth, as well as the spiritual creatures associated with each. The Elemental Gods, Archangels, rulers and other types of elemental beings (including Sylphs, Salamanders, Undines &amp; Gnomes) are discussed and explored.</p><p>Both the spiritual and physical aspects of the four elements are considered, together with how they interact with each other and their appropriate use for magickal work. The creation and use of Elementaries (Elemental Thought Forms); Elemental Tools, the Elemental Tides and correspondences are all considered in detail, together with previously unavailable original ritual &amp; meditative material including the Unification Rite, the Inner Talisman, the Elemental Pyramids, the Elemental Magick Circle &amp; the Elemental Temples.</p><p>In mastering the four elements within &amp; without we master ourselves, bringing the external forces of the natural world &amp; the internal forces of our existence into harmony.</p></p><p>Sorita d'Este is an author, researcher and publisher who manifests her knowledge and passion for the Mysteries through her work. Her research and writing pushes at the boundaries of Western Esoterica and beyond, often questioning and challenging the status quo and inspiring others towards experiential mysticism with firm foundations built on lessons learned from history, standing positively in today and looking with enthusiasm towards the future.

He has been writing and contributing articles to a variety of publications on the subjects close to his heart since the early 1980s. These include Heka (Egyptian magic), the Qabalah, Medieval and Renaissance magic (particularly the grimoires), modern ceremonial magic, mythology and folklore. Since 2003 he has been working with Stephen Skinner, co-writing and producing the highly acclaimed Sourceworks of Ceremonial Magic series. These books make available previously unpublished manuscripts and Grimoires of great significance to the development of modern magic, and have opened the field of study regarding the development of magick in the last thousand years. David actively promotes the propagation of rare texts and source documents, and is a member of both Societas Magica and ESSWE (European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism). David has contributed numerous articles to esoteric publications such as The Watkins Review, Skoob Occult Review, Nuit-Isis, Celtic Dawn, Chaos International, Witchcraft &amp; Wicca, Pagan Dawn, Talking Stick. During the period 2002-04 he contributed around 300 articles to the D'Agostini international part-work Enhancing Your Mind Body Spirit. His contributions to this very successful worldwide publication included articles and entire sections on Crystals, Healing, Chakras, Qabalah, Shamanism, Ancient Egyptian Magick, Alchemy and Angels. Since the early 1980s David has facilitated hundreds of workshops, lectures, and presentations throughout the UK and Europe, concentrating on the subjects he is passionate about - including the Grimoire Tradition, Qabalah, Angelic Magic, Egyptian and Celtic Mythology and spirituality. David has appeared on many television and radio programs over the years. His work and interviews with him have featured in numerous publications including The Guardian, The Sunday Times, TIME OUT, Alternative London and many others.

From Empedocles, Iamblichus, Ancient Greek magic and religion, Paracelsus, the Qabalah, the Grimoire Tradition and more contemporary sources, David and Sorita have conjured a gem of occult literature that will take beginner and adept alike on a enchanting journey of exploring the ideas and manifestations of magic inherent within the elements.

I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to learn classical wisdom that affects our lives today." <em>L. Shugerman, Amazon Reviewer</em></p><p>"Although the use of elements is the foundation of magickal practice, this book is genuinely the first of its kind. There are many books on the elements, rituals, creatures, etc.; However, while I find the majority of those books to be very polite and tiptoeing around the elemental beings- this book teaches the practitioner to truly connect with those forces and beings and how to control their power for the magickal intent. To the authors' credit Practical Elemental Magick is non-dogmatic and, therefore, is extremely useful for a variety of Occult traditions- from novice to the advanced magician." <em>Indigo Astrea, WitchTalk Radio / Amazon Reviewer</em></p><p>"Practical Elemental Magick is an essential book for magick practitioners.

A collection of interviews with women discussing their sexuality and fantasies, it became a huge bestseller. Friday's subsequent books, including "Men in Love," "My Mother/My Self," and "Women on Top," cover topics ranging from mothers and daughters, to jealousy, to feminism.<p>Excerpt from Author to Reader: Still My Secret Garden</p> <p>Over thirty-five years ago, I called it My Secret Garden because collecting fantasies was like listening to women whispering in my ear. I was hearing their deepest erotic secrets&#x2014;in many cases, desires they had not even told themselves until then. Still today, many women and men finish by saying, "Thank you for letting me tell you."</p> <p>I know precisely what they mean. There is something about putting sex into writing, almost as if we are taking it to the next level of reality, getting closer and closer to the flame. At the same time, it is emboldening, as in: "This is who I am&#x2014;who I really am! And look...the sky hasn't fallen, I haven't been ostracized from the family, and I feel more complete, whole, part of the human race."</p> <p>Yes, I do believe that for many of us, accepting our erotic reveries opens a new consciousness in our lives. We don't have to act on the fantasies to feel this way. Some, fully realized, would become nightmares. Nor share them with our partners. Often, kept from them, they can be even more emboldening. It is thrilling just to own the creativity of our sexual imagination. Just as learning to drive opens new paths&#x2014;emotionally as well as physically&#x2014;so do our private sexual thoughts, at any age, take us on ever-new trips, as doors open and horizons broaden.</p> <p>We like to think that we are formed by what we choose to take in, while from the day we were born, we have been absorbing the opinions of the people on whom we are dependent. Our caretakers' opinions (often unspoken) of our body are woven into our self-image. Later, changes that we choose to make will be in opposition to theirs.</p> <p>Our tiny hand goes between our legs because it feels good and, yes, because it is our body. So, there we are, not even able to use adverbs, and the giants of the nursery are laying down lifelong prejudices. They say, "No, no, darling..." and remove our hand from that sweet crevice. We won't remember it or a dozen other repeated sounds and actions that over time hammer home their opinions of our genitals.</p> <p>So often our devoted caretakers would deny any role in turning us away from our sexual parts, so automatic and unthinking were their intentions. If accused in court of crippling someone's sexual self-esteem, they would look askance.</p> <p>By the time we choose a sexual mate, have a certificate of marriage, or become economically independent, we will also have a private stash of erotic fantasies, stored since adolescence, helping us get past the negative opinions of other people regarding our sexual parts. Now, when our mind and body want to boost us up, up, and away into orgasm, we call upon these fantasies to do their magic.</p> <p>Our response to the thrill of sexual feeling in adolescence is electric. It is so sweet, so winning, yes, so natural, that it is hard to ally it with the negative experience long ago in the nursery.</p> <p>This is something new and beautiful, what we feel in one another's arms at adolescence. That so many young girls get pregnant when they have been raised never to let a lad anywhere near that forbidden fertile ground until the appropriate moment speaks of the beauty of erotic rapture&#x2014;something the girl might understand and deal with had she been taught to respect "that place." But raised on distaste and abhorrence of her genitals, the girl eagerly hands herself over to the boy/man and crowns him a Prince for loving that "unspeakable" core of herself. Before the sexual revolution of the twentieth century, most women denied their erotic fantasies. Young adults today find that hard to believe. Where did these forbidden, unacceptable fantasies go after they were enjoyed, these rich erotic thoughts that accompanied our sex? Can the mind actually entertain a sexual fantasy during intercourse or masturbation and then erase it post-orgasm?</p> <p>I thought I'd heard everything with regard to my favorite subject until I received this missive in 2002 from a twenty-threeyear-old English woman:</p> <p>"Dear Nancy, I always thought it was only famous, rich, successful&#x2014;as in some way privileged women&#x2014;who had sexual fantasies. Finding out that so many ORDINARY WOMEN [her caps] enjoy sex so much is a fantastic thing to know. It makes me feel so much better to realize that anyone can have a great sex life."</p> <p>Such a funny, sweet thought makes me want to put my arm around the dear girl and welcome her into the club.</p> <p>But, of course, masturbation only came onto the scene, front and center, in the last thirty years. Certainly, some women masturbated but not in the epidemic proportions we do today. (Hah! Fun to imagine an "epidemic" of women masturbating; the headlines in the newspapers: "All traffic comes to a halt as women across the world masturbate for world peace!")</p></p><h2>Mazda Miata MX-5 Performance Projects (Motorbooks Workshop)</h2><p>The Mazda Miata MX-5 has been a popular car among automotive enthusiasts for more than a decade, and hardly a single one of the more than 500,000 sold has not been customized by its owner in some way.

Unfortunately for him, one of his targets is a retired Marine general, whose son is TOSA&#x2019;s top tracker of men.<br><br>The Preacher has made it personal&#x2014;and now the hunt is on....</p><p><b>Frederick Forsyth </b>is the author of sixteen novels and short story collections, from <i>The Day of the Jackal</i>, <i>The Odessa File</i>, and <i>The Dogs of War</i> to, most recently, <i>The Afghan</i> and <i>The Cobra</i>. A former pilot and print and television reporter for Reuters and the BBC, he has had five movies and a television miniseries made from his works. In 2012, he won the Diamond Dagger Award from the Crime Writers&#x2019; Association for a career of sustained excellence. He lives in Buckinghamshire, England.A retired marine general is gunned down by an unknown assassin&#x2014;collateral damage, apparently, in an attack on a U.S. senator. The general&#x2019;s son, code-named the Tracker, is part of a top-secret government agency responsible for locating, and eliminating (without benefit of trial), people on the so-called &#x201c;kill list&#x201d; of enemies of the U.S. The Tracker knows almost nothing about the assassin, not even his name, but he is determined to find him, no matter the cost. Imagine Forsyth&#x2019;s The Day of the Jackal told almost entirely from the point of view of investigator Claude Lebel, and you&#x2019;ll have a pretty good idea of the author&#x2019;s approach here: this is a procedural told in a straightforward, reportorial style. Forsyth has always been a no-nonsense writer, eschewing flashy prose in favor of documentary realism, incorporating real-world elements into his stories (the Tracker and his adversary are made up, but the government agency is based in reality). No one writes them quite like Forsyth, and this more than meets his usual high standards. --David Pitt</p><h2>Batgirl 1: The Darkest Reflection</h2><p>A <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Best Seller!<br><br>As a part of the acclaimed DC Comics&#x2014;The New 52 event of September 2011, Barbara Gordon is finally back as Batgirl!<p>The nightmare-inducing brute known as Mirror is destroying the lives of Gotham City citizens seemingly at random.

Step by foolish step, my pride had brought me to this bitter, frozen end. Though the terrain was intensely beautiful, all that waited for me here was my own death.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At more than 14,000 feet, I dangled motionless above an infinite void. I clung with a white-knuckled grip to the only device that could save me, my ice ax. Hanging from a near-vertical sheet of ice only yards below a mountain summit, I was surrounded by a silent world of white. The expanse around me no longer concealed the fact that this could be the exquisite location where my life would end. Frayed thoughts twisted around the clutter of all my what-ifs. Finally the noisy and confused voices within my mind stilled. All that remained of my broken ability to reason circled in my head like a lost boomerang, proclaiming with each weak pass the same whispered message:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>How did it come to this?<br></i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the highlights of my life occurred when I was five years old. Seared like a brand on my soul, the memory of that moment feels me with heat even now. Earlier on that long-ago day, with all the determination and strength that a little heart could muster, I&#x2019;d gripped the back pockets of my dad&#x2019;s 501 jeans. Like a human mule, he&#x2019;d patiently towed his youngest daughter up her first mountain. At 10,457 feet, requiring a round trip of less than five miles, Mount Lassen&#x2019;s small volcanic summit is not much of a challenge for those who frequent the high places. But for a young girl, reaching its peak was a triumph of love and wonder.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While my dad and I sat shielded by a rock wall, I snuggled close to him for warmth. The wind seemed to resent the vertical detour demanded by this small volcano and screamed all around us. My hair whipped around my face in a frenzied mass of black knots. With nothing above us but sky, I huddled in awe, captivated by the wonder that swept down and away like a living, undulating quilt of unthinkable beauty. Distinct from anything forged by the hands of men, this exquisite mantle continued beyond human sight in a decadent tapestry. Great forests appeared as deep folds of green and rushed down to embrace a myriad of sapphire lakes. Caught up in Creation&#x2019;s never-ending flow, green eventually gave way to amber as forests poured into vast plains of golden grass.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid compression of air moving over the volcano&#x2019;s peak created cloud spindles. The white wisps appeared before our eyes, danced wildly across the summit, and disappeared just as swiftly. I was certain my dad and I were the only two people on earth who saw them. Like translucent sprites they tumbled and rolled in captivating shapes. Through exuberant eyes I watched them call me to join in their frolic. They seemed to play from the beginning of their brief lives right up to their last twisting moments. Spiraling down into threadlike strands of white, they waved one last good-bye before dissipating forever into a heavenly ocean of blue.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That moment with my dad on Lassen ignited in my heart a deep and passionate love for the mountains. There was an indescribable, fierce power in these high places&#x2014;and also incredible wonder and beauty. I was hooked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, more favor poured into my life when my dad was hired as a weekend downhill ski instructor on the lower flanks of northern California&#x2019;s Mount Shasta. At 14,162 feet, Shasta isn&#x2019;t the highest peak in the lower forty-eight states. But most agree that by sheer mass, it&#x2019;s one of the biggest. Shasta&#x2019;s base-to-summit rise of nearly ten thousand feet is second only to Mount Rainier and Mount Whitney in the contiguous United States. As an active, stand-alone volcano, Shasta dominates the horizon for more than one hundred miles in every direction.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often I joined my dad in this impressive setting. I vividly recall one day hanging between his lanky legs as he held me under my arms. I stood on tiny wooden skis fastened with cable bindings to huge boots. &#x201c;Ready, Kimbo?&#x201d; my dad asked with the enthusiasm of a parent gifting his child with something he loves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, we perched on the crest of what my youthful perspective saw as a daring precipice. With the pure, unshakable faith of a child, I looked at my dad&#x2019;s slender thighs and saw the trunks of two strong oaks. His grasp was firm enough to convince me that as long as I was locked in his protective embrace, we could ski through any peril. Had I glanced up, I&#x2019;m sure I would&#x2019;ve seen his superhero cape wafting majestically behind<br>him. I braced myself by pressing mittened hands on the inside of each of his thighs. Like a pint-size copilot, I bobbed my head and said, &#x201c;Okay, Daddy.&#x201d; We pushed off into a serpentine world of white, the beginning of many glorious weekends filled with father-daughter adventures.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That string of shared activities ended, however, much too soon. I was nine years old when the inconceivable happened. Divorce was tearing our family apart. My dad sought help in many professional directions, but, tragically, the help he so desperately needed was not to be found. One day a friend of my father&#x2019;s picked up my sisters and me from school and took us to our grandparents&#x2019; house. No one spoke. During that drive I knew something catastrophic had happened. At my grandparents&#x2019;&nbsp; house a distraught woman tried to comfort me in her arms. She kept repeating, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m so deeply sorry.&#x201d; Finally she blurted out, &#x201c;Your father has just murdered your mother and killed himself.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first thought was that she was a liar. She <i>had </i>to be a liar because what she said simply could not be true.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tore away and burst out the house&#x2019;s back door. I ran and ran through a small orchard until I fell, facedown, in the powdery, dry earth. I heard screaming and realized it was coming from me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Jesus, help me!&#x201d; I cried. &#x201c;Help me!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, He did.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#x2019;t really know who Jesus was. I&#x2019;d been to church only a few times in my life. Yet in that moment of despair, I somehow knew He was the only safe direction I could turn and if I didn&#x2019;t, I would die.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I understand now is how on that terrible day the Lord of all Creation came and knelt in the dirt beside a breaking child. He reached down and took the small hand that reached up to Him...and He has<br><i>never</i> let go.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only through His grace did I begin picking up the pieces of my shattered life. My sisters and I moved in with my grandparents and started attending church. In the years that followed, I learned that Jesus was my Redeemer and my shelter. Despite the grief and despair I faced, I always found comfort in Him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of my refuges was the mountains. Once I began driving, I set about climbing every horizon&#x2014;no matter where that horizon was. In these wind-chiseled cathedrals of stone, my heart felt truly free. The subtle, mighty voice of breezes murmuring through ancient, high-altitude forests perpetually called me to come and rest within their boughs of peace. Heavy sorrows and burdens felt too weighty to follow me to these wild places. The farther I hiked, the farther behind I left my pain. I sensed that all the tragedies that gripped my heart were not strong enough to chase me into thin air. I scaled many of the peaks surrounding California&#x2019;s Redding basin. Once my husband, Troy, and I moved to Central Oregon, I climbed most of that skyline as well. The one glaring omission from my ascensions was Mount Shasta. Believing it would be too painful, I purposed in my heart never to go back.</p><h2>Ghost Story Dice</h2><p>Revive the art of storytelling using these nine beautifully illustrated wooden dice to create ghostly stories. <br><br>Construct your own spooky adventure tale with an array of creepy characters like vampires, headless horsemen, and decapitated knights.

Lost memories, lost relationships, regret-each poem pierces and then releases readers, who pocket a new treasure at the end of each page. Naomi Nye has brought together over 100 selections from well-known adult poets as well as from those who are new or not widely published, from around the world. Notes on the contributors include quotes from the poets about their lives and work. Jennifer Weinblatt says, "Teenagers are often accused of melodrama, but there is a lot of genuine drama inherent in the teenage years...," and this sensibility permeates the collection. Michael Nye's black-and-white photographic portraits are as inventive and speak as much as the poems; in fact, they work best if viewed as independent works of art, instead of as illustrations. They add to the precise design of the book, on whose pages the words "What Have You Lost?" "What Have You Found?" float like random, ghostly reminders. As with Ruth Gordon's collection, Pierced by a Ray of Sun (HarperCollins, 1995), and Liz Rosenberg's Earth-Shattering Poems (Holt, 1995), What Have You Lost? puts into the hands of young adults new poems that speak to that intensely lonely, but consciousness-exploding time when they find themselves "Lost again,/where the world begins" (John Brandi's "Wilderness Poem").<br><i>Nina Lindsay, Oakland Public Library, CA</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Skull Mantra (Inspector Shan Tao Yun, 1)</h2><p><p>Winner of the 2001 Edgar Award for Best First Novel, The Skull Mantra was a sensation when first published and received wide acclaim from critics and readers alike. The Skull Mantra is ranked as a novel about a people and a place--the Tibetans of the high Himalayas--as it is a gripping thriller. </p><p>The corpse is missing its head and is dressed in American clothes. Found by a Tibetan prison work gang on a windy cliff, the grisly remains clearly belong to someone too important for Chinese authorities to bury and forget. So the case is handed to veteran police inspector Shan Tao Yun. Methodical, clever Shan is the best man for the job, but he too is a prisoner, deported to Tibet for offending someone high up in Beijing's power structure. Granted a temporary release, Shan is soon pulled into the Tibetan people's desperate fight for its sacred mountains and the Chinese regime's blood-soaked policies. Then, a Buddhist priest is arrested, a man Shan knows is innocent. Now time is running out for Shan to find the real killer. </p><p><i>The Skull Mantra</i> is the winner of the 2000 Edgar Award for Best First Novel.</p></p><p>Not many political thrillers are set in Tibet, and few can match the power and poetry of this debut novel by journalist Eliot Pattison. At the heart of the story is a forced labor camp where the Chinese imprison Buddhist monks and other local dissidents they've swept up since taking over Tibet. The prison also holds a few special Chinese prisoners--including Shan Tao Yun. This middle-aged man was once the inspector general of the Ministry of Economy in Beijing, specializing in fraud cases. For reasons even he doesn't understand, he has been imprisoned and brutalized, and now he spends his days breaking rocks high in the Himalayas on a road crew called the People's 404th Construction Brigade. Shan manages to survive under these harsh conditions thanks to the spiritual guidance of his fellow prisoners, but this precarious balance is threatened by the discovery of the headless body of a local Chinese official near a road construction site.<p> The dead man's head soon turns up in a famous shrine--a cave that contains the skulls of heroic monks. The shrewd Red Army colonel in charge of the district asks Shan to conduct an investigation: offers of better food and conditions combined with threats against his monk friends convinces him to take on the task. Colonel Tan wants a fast resolution that imcriminates a mute, passive monk found near the cave, but Shan is certain that the man isn't guilty. More likely killers include other high-ranking Chinese officials, as well as some American mining capitalists who had personal as well as financial dealings with the dead man. </p><p> By engaging his readers in a mass of details, Pattison makes us believe completely in Shan and his perilous situation--and creates a rare combination of excitement and enlightenment. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Eliot Pattison is a world traveler and frequent visitor to China, whose numerous books and articles on international policy issues have been published on three continents.

He campaigned ceaselessly for African solidarity and for the liberation of southern Africa from white settler rule. His greatest achievement was to win the right of black peoples in Africa to have a vote and to determine their own destiny.<br><br> He turned a dream of liberation into a political reality. He was the leader of Ghana who urged Africa to shed the colonial yoke and who inspired black people everywhere to seek their freedom.<br><br> This revised edition of Birmingham's fine and accessible biography chronicles the public accomplishments of this extraordinary leader, who faced some of the century's most challenging political struggles over colonial transition. African nationalism, and pan-Africanism. It also relates some of the personal trials of a complex individual.<br><br> As a student in America in the late 1930s, Nkrumah, shy, disorganized, but ambitious and persistent, earned four degrees in ten years. For political training he then went to England. Nkrumah found writing difficult throughout his lifetime, but once back in his African homeland, with its oral heritage, Nkrumah blossomed as a charming conversationalist, a speechmaker, and eventually a visionary and inspiring leader.<br><br> Nkrumah's crusades were controversial, however, and in the 1960s he gradually lost his heroic stature both among his own people and among his fellow leaders. He lived his last years in exile.<br><br> This remarkable life story, which touches on many of the issues facing modern Africa, will open a window of understanding for the general leader as well as for graduate and undergraduate classes.<br><br> In this new edition, Birmingham also examines Nkrumah's exile and provides insight into the image of Nkrumah that has emerged in the light of research recently published.</p></p><p><p><b>David Birmingham</b> lived in Switzerland from 1947 to 1954 as a child and returned there in the 1990s as a visiting historian.

This short monograph on Pulcinella is conceived as a extension of the <i>Codex Seraphinianus</i>, an encyclopedia filled with variations and fantasies on a theme.&nbsp;<i>Pulcinellopaedia Seraphiniana</i> contains over one hundred extraordinary graphite illustrations with scarlet accents, some of which are depicted in comic-strip style. Conceived as a musical <i>Suite, </i>it is<i> </i>divided into nine scenes with an intermission. It features the oddly surreal and globally recognized character, whose origins have been lost in the mists of the time. An ancestor of Pulcinella was certainly Maccus, the protagonist of the <i>Atellanae</i> <i>Fabulae</i>, very popular farces in ancient Rome, but it was in the early seventeenth-century that the character assumed the name and costume that we all know.<br> &nbsp;<br> Distinguished by a long nose and typically dressed in white with a black mask, Pulcinella is often depicted in various kinds of misadventures and singing about love, hunger, and money. As he famously did in the <i>Codex</i>, Luigi Serafini, has created <i>Pulcinellopaedia Seraphiniana</i> in a unique language all its own, and has filled it with fascinating and mysterious illustrations that will no doubt prompt devotees to obsessively try to decipher the artist&#x2019;s intention. Written by Serafini&#x2019;s imaginative coauthor and alter ego "P. Cetrulo," who represents Pulcinella himself, the book artfully presents the struggles of a rebellious antihero who must come to grips with the challenges of everyday life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Originally, a book about Pulcinella and his world appeared in 1984, after Serafini&#x2019;s involvement with the 1982 Carnival of Venice, the first revival of the famous festivity after two centuries of silence. Now more than three decades later, this new edition has been extensively revised and includes a new afterword by the author. Like its predecessor, the original edition became immensely sought after and highly valuable, fetching more than one thousand dollars if book collectors were lucky enough to get their hands on a copy. All fans of Serafini&#x2019;s work will treasure this volume. Rizzoli will also publish a deluxe limited edition with a signed and numbered print.</p><p><b>Luigi Serafini</b> was born in Rome in 1949.

In this provocative book, Flack shows how the transcendence occurs, in the art of looking as well as in the moment of creation. With its wonderfully acute critiques of artists from Tintoretto to Jackson Pollock and its insistence on reforging the links between the artist and larger world, <i>Art and Soul</i> is a brave, nourishing book that will inspire not only visual artists but anyone who has chosen the creative path.</p><p>AUDREY FLACK is a highly celebrated American artist.

The guitarist and de facto leader of the Grateful Dead was a gregarious talker, keenly engaged with the new world exploding around him. In 1972, Garcia was visited by Charles Reich, a Yale law professor, and Jann Wenner, the founder of <i>Rolling Stone</i>. Garcia was just thirty-one years old but already viewed--to his lasting dismay--as a social avatar for the new sensibility sweeping the land, an anarchist streak with a populist undercurrent that had roots in Ken Kesey's pranksters, the writers of the Beat Generation, and the libertine tradition of the American transcendentalists. In this interview, Garcia reveals how he is a combination of these and other influences, a high-school dropout and autodidact blessed with a gift for eloquent turns of phrase and a refreshing directness. He speaks of the saga of the Grateful Dead and his hoodlum youth growing up in San Francisco's Mission district. He delves into fascinating discourses on the music that shaped his own playing and writing, and freely discusses his use of drugs and explains why he felt it was important to stay high. Like the Grateful Dead's best music, <i>Garcia: A Signpost to New Space</i> is familiar, friendly, and inviting.</p><p>Charles Reich is Professor of Law at Yale University and the author of <i>The Greening of America</i>.

It&#x2019;s a pretty arresting thought.&#x201d; He also happens to own and run a country inn that is haunted.

And then there is always death. <br><br>The Green Man is a ghost story that hits a live nerve, a very black comedy with an uncannily happy ending: in other words, Kingsley Amis at his best.</p><p>Kingsley Amis (1922&#x2013;1995) was a popular and prolific British novelist, poet, and critic, widely regarded as one of the greatest satirical writers of the twentieth century. Born in suburban South London, the only child of a clerk in the office of the mustard-maker Colman&#x2019;s, he went to the City of London School on the Thames before winning an English scholarship to St. John&#x2019;s College, Oxford, where he began a lifelong friendship with fellow student Philip Larkin. Following service in the British Army&#x2019;s Royal Corps of Signals during World War II , he completed his degree and joined the faculty at the University College of Swansea in Wales. <i>Lucky Jim</i>, his first novel, appeared in 1954 to great acclaim and won a Somerset Maugham Award. Amis spent a year as a visiting fellow in the creative writing department of Princeton University and in 1961 became a fellow at Peterhouse College, Cambridge, but resigned the position two years later, lamenting the incompatibility of writing and teaching (&#x201c;I found myself fit for nothing much more exacting than playing the gramophone after three supervisions a day&#x201d;). Ultimately he published twenty-four novels, including science fiction and a James Bond sequel; more than a dozen collections of poetry, short stories, and literary criticism; restaurant reviews and three books about drinking; political pamphlets and a memoir; and more. Amis received the Booker Prize for his novel <i>The Old Devils</i> in 1986 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990. He had three children, among them the novelist Martin Amis, with his first wife, Hilary Anne Bardwell, from whom he was divorced in 1965. After his second, eighteen-year marriage to the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard ended in 1983, he lived in a London house with his first wife and her third husband.<br><br>Michael Dirda is a longtime book columnist for <i>The Washington Post</i> and the author, most recently, of <i>Classics for Pleasure</i> and the 2012 Edgar Award&#x2013;winning <i>On Conan Doyle</i>.THE RED-HAIRED WOMAN<br>FAREHAM, Herts<br>1/2 mile off A595<br>&nbsp;<br>THE GREEN MAN<br>Mill End 0043<br>&nbsp;<br>No sooner has one gone over one's surprise at finding a genuine coaching inn less than 40 miles from London&#x2014;and 8 from the M1&#x2014;than one is marvelling at the quality of the equally genuine English fare (the occasional disaster apart!).

I take whatever my wine supplier will let me have at a good price (which I would never dream of doing with any other drinkable). I enjoyed seeing those glasses of Chablis or Pouilly Fuiss�, so closely resembling a blend of cold chalk soup and alum cordial with an additive or two to bring it to the colour of children's pee, being peered and sniffed at, rolled round the shrinking tongue and forced down somehow by parties of young technology dons from Cambridge or junior television producers and their girls. Minor, harmless compensations of this sort are all too rare in a modern innkeeper's day.<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, most of my trade did come either from London or the twenty-odd miles from Cambridge, with a little more from the nearest Hertfordshire towns. I got the occasional passer-by, of course, but not as many as my colleagues on the A10 to the east of me and the A505 to the north-west. The A595 is a mere sub-artery connecting Stevenage and Royston, and although I put up a sign on it the day I opened, not many transients ever bothered to turn off and try to find the Green Man in preference to using one of the pubs directly beside the main road. All right with me, that. About my only point of agreement with John Fothergill, the buckle-shoed posturer who had the Spread Eagle in Thame when I was a boy and founded a reputation and a book on being nasty to his guests, is lack of warmth towards the sort of people who use two halves of bitter and two tomato juices as a quadruple ticket to the lavatories and washbasins. The villagers from Fareham itself, and from Sandon and Mill End, each of the two about a mile away, were obviously a different matter. They put back their pints steadily and quietly in the public bar, filling it at week-ends, and had an agreeable short way with dinner-jacketed seekers after rustic atmosphere or the authentic life of the working class.<br>&nbsp;<br>The locals, with some assistance from the various hearty young men who came in to dine, got through plenty of beer, as much as a couple of dozen tens of bitter a week in the summer. Whatever might be said about its prices, the wine too went quickly enough. Refusing, as I have always done, to offer any but fresh meat, vegetables and fruit, poses a daily transport problem. All this, together with keeping up stocks of salt and metal-polish, flowers and toothpicks, takes a good deal of arranging. One way and another, I used to spend a good two or three hours of almost every day out of my house. But this could be less than a hardship to a man with a newish second wife, a teenaged daughter by a first marriage, and an ancient and decrepit father (apart from a staff of nine) to be variously coped with.<br>&nbsp;<br>Last summer, in particular, would have taxed a more hardened and versatile coper than me.

A party of sociology students from &nbsp;Cambridge, rebuked for exchanging obscenities at protest-meeting volume, poured beer over young David Palmer, my trainee assistant, and then staged a sit-in. After nearly a year of no worse than average conduct, the Spanish kitchen porter went into a heavy bout of Peeping Tom behaviour, notably but not at all exclusively at the grille outside the ladies' lavatory, attracted the attention of the police and was finally deported. The deep-fat fryer caught fire twice, once during a session of the South Hertfordshire branch of the Wine and Food Society. My wife seemed lethargic, my daughter withdrawn. My father, now in his eightieth year, had another stroke, his third, not serious in itself but not propitious.

In the morning there had been trouble with the repatriated voyeur's successor, Ramon, who had refused to pile and burn the rubbish on the grounds that he had already had to do the breakfast dishes. Then, while I was picking up the tea, coffee and such at the dry-goods warehouse in Baldock, the ice-maker had broken down. It never performed with much conviction in hot weather, and the temperature most of that week was in the upper seventies. An electrician had to be found and fetched. Three sets of hotel guests with four young children between them, no doubt under orders from anti-hotelier HQ, turned up from nowhere between 5.30 and 5.40. My wife succeeded almost totally in blaming this on me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Later, having settled my father in front of the open drawing-room window with a weak Scotch-and-water, I came out of our apartment on the upper storey to find somebody standing, back turned to me, near the stairhead. I took this person for a woman in an evening dress rather heavy for a humid August evening. There was no function in the banqueting chamber, the only public room on that floor, until the following week, and our apartment was clearly marked as private.<br>&nbsp;<br>With my best offensive suavity, I said, 'Can I help you, madam?'<br>&nbsp;<br>Instantly, but without a sound, the figure turned to face me. I vaguely saw a pale, thin-lipped face, heavy auburn ringlets, and some kind of large bluish pendant at the throat. Much more clearly than this, I sensed a surprise and alarm that seemed disproportionate: my arrival on the landing could hardly have been inaudible to one only twenty feet away, and it was obvious enough who I was. <br>&nbsp;<br>At that moment my father called to me, and without thinking I looked away.<br>&nbsp;<br>'Yes, Father?'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Oh, Maurice ... could you send up an evening paper? The local one will do.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'I'll get Fred to bring one up.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Soon, if you would, Maurice, and if Fred's free.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Yes, Father.'<br>&nbsp;<br>This took no more than a dozen seconds, but when they were over the landing was empty. The woman must have decided to cut short her display of heightened sensitivity and pursue her search on the ground floor. No doubt she was more successful there, for I saw nothing of her as I came down the stairs, crossed the few feet of hall and entered the front bar.<br>&nbsp;<br>This long, low room, with small windows revealing the thickness of its outer wall, and normally cool and dry in summer, was stickily oppressive that evening. Fred Soames , the barman, had the fans going, but as I joined him behind the counter and waited for him to finish serving a round of drinks, I could feel sweat trickling down under my frilled shirt and dinner-jacket. I was uneasy too, and not just in my habitual unlocalized way. I was bothered by something about the appearance or demeanour of the woman I had seen on the landing, something it was now too late to define. Even less reasonably, I felt certain that, when my father called to me, he had changed his mind about what he wanted to say. I could not imagine what his original thought had been, and, again, I would not now be able to find out. His memory in such cases extended over seconds only.<br>&nbsp;<br>I sent Fred off with the paper, served, in his absence, three medium sherries and (with concealed distaste) a lager and lime, and took a party of early diners through the menu, pushing the rather boring salmon and some incipiently elderly pork a little less gently than the Good Food Guide might have approved. After that, a visit to the kitchen, where David Palmer and the chef had everything under control, including Ram�n, who assured me that he was not now desiring to return to Espain. Then, a call at the tiny office under the angle of the main staircase. My wife was listlessly working her way through the bills, but lost some of her listlessness (she never seemed to lose quite all of it) on being told to forget all that crap for now and go up and change. She even gave me a hasty kiss on the ear. Returning to the bar by way of the still-room, where I swallowed down a very large Scotch put there for me by<br>Fred, I did some more takings-through the menu. The last of the batch was an elderly couple from Baltimore, on their way to Cambridge in search of things historical and breaking their journey at my house to take in a few of the same, or similar. The man, a retired lawyer, had evidently been doing his homework, not a testing task in this instance. Periphrastically but courteously, he inquired after our ghost, or ghosts.<br>&nbsp;<br>I went into the routine, first piously turning down a drink. 'The main one was somebody called Dr Thomas Underhill who lived here in the later seventeenth century. He was in holy orders, but he wasn't the parson of the parish; he was a scholar who for some reason gave up his Cambridge fellowship and bought this place. He&#x2019;s buried in that little churchyard just up the road, but he nearly didn't get buried at all. He was so wicked that when he died the sexton wouldn't dig a grave for him, and the local rector refused to officiate at his funeral. They had to get a sexton from Royston, and a clergyman all the way from Peterhouse in Cambridge. Some of the people round about said that Underhill had killed his wife, whom he used to quarrel with a lot, apparently, and he was also supposed to have brought about the death of a farmer he'd had trouble with over some land deal.<br>&nbsp;<br>'Well, the odd thing is that both these people were murdered all right, half torn to pieces, in fact, in the most brutal way but in both cases the bodies were found in the open, at almost the same spot on the road to the village, although the murders were six years apart, and on both occasions it was established beyond doubt that UnderhIll was indoors here at the time. The obvious guess is that he hired chaps to do the job for him, but they were never caught, nobody even saw them, and the force used on the victims, they say, was disproportionate for an ordinary commercial killing.<br>&nbsp;<br>'Anyway, Underhill, or rather his ghost, turned up, quite a few times at a window in what's now part of the diningroom, peering out and apparently watching something. All the witnesses seem to have been very struck by the expression on his face and his general demeanour, but, according to the story, there was a lot of disagreement about what he actually looked like. One chap said he thought Underhill was behaving as if he were terrified out of his wits. Someone else thought he was showing the detached curiosity of a man of science observing an experiment. It doesn't sound very consistent, does it? But then ... '<br>&nbsp;<br>'Could it not be, Mr Allington, could it not be that this ... apparition was engaged, if one might so put the matter, in ... surveying the actuality of the crimes, or the, the shadow of the actuality of the crimes he had brought to pass, and that the various observers were witnessing successive stages in his reaction to the spectacle of brutal violence, from ... clinical disinterest to horror, and it might be, agonized remorse?'<br>&nbsp;<br>'An interesting point.' I did not add that it had occurred, in a less Jamesian form, to almost everybody who had heard this story. 'But in that case he was standing at the wrong window, facing away from the spot where the murders were done towards a patch of woods. Nothing has ever happened there as far as I know, nothing to do with this business anyway.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'I see. Then let me turn to another consideration. In the latter part of your strange and fascinating tale, Mr Allington, that concerning the figure of ... the revenant, I noticed that you employed the past tense, thereby ... implying that these manifestations are also a thing of the past. Is that, would that be correct, sir?'<br>&nbsp;<br>The old lad's brain could evidently work a little faster than his organs of speech. 'Quite correct. Nothing has been seen since I took over the house seven years ago, and the people I bought it from, who'd had it for much longer, had never seen anything either. They had heard that an elderly relative of a predecessor had been frightened by what could have been Underhill's ghost when he was a boy, but that must have been in Victorian times. No, I'm<br>afraid if there ever was anything, it's all over now.<br>'<br>'Just so. I have read that this house has known at least one ghost, which would seem to ... indicate the possibility, at least, of another.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Yes. Nothing was ever actually seen of him at any stage. A few people said they used to hear somebody walking round the outside of the house at night and trying the doors and windows. Of course, every village must have two or three characters who wouldn't be averse to a bit of burglary at a place of this size if they could find an easy entry.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Did nobody take the obvious course of looking out to see ... what there might have been to see?'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Apparently not. They said they didn't like the noise whoever it was made while he was going round. He rustled and crackled as he moved. That's as much sense as I've been able to make of it.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'And this ... person also no longer visits the scene?'<br>&nbsp;<br>'No.'<br>&nbsp;<br>I spoke a little shortly. I usually enjoyed telling all this, but tonight it seemed silly, fully vouched for by written evidence and yet at the same time a blatant piece of stock-in-trade. My heart was beating irregularly and uncomfortably and I longed for another drink. My clothes were glueing themselves to me in the damp heat, which seemed to be increasing as the evening advanced. I did my best to listen to further inquiries, mainly about the documentary basis for my story. These I checked by saying, untruthfully, that I had nothing of the sort in my own possession, and that all the stuff was in the county archives in Hertford town. The last stages of the conversation were lengthened by my guest's habit of pausing frequently in search ...</p><h2>Sara Moulton&#39;s Everyday Family Dinners</h2><p>Sara Moulton may be a professional chef and television personality, but she&#x2019;s also a working mother who has to get dinner on the table for her husband and kids every night.

From Chancellorsville, where General Robert E. Lee launched his high-risk campaign into the North, to the Confederates' last daring and ultimately-doomed act, forever known as Pickett's Charge, the battle of Gettysburg gave the Union army a victory that turned back the boldest and perhaps greatest chance for a Southern nation.</p><p>Now acclaimed historian Noah Andre Trudeau brings the most up-to-date research available to a brilliant, sweeping, and comprehensive history of the battle of Gettysburg that sheds fresh light on virtually every aspect of it. Deftly balancing his own narrative style with revealing firsthand accounts, Trudeau brings this engrossing human tale to life as never before.</p></p><p><p>Noah Andre Trudeau is the author of <em>Gettysburg</em>. He has won the Civil War Round Table of New York's Fletcher Pratt Award and the Jerry Coffey Memorial Prize. A former executive producer at National Public Radio, he lives in Washington, D.C. </p>Making comprehensive and sophisticated use of a broad spectrum of archival and printed sources, NPR executive producer Trudeau (Bloody Roads South) enhances his reputation as a narrative historian of the Civil War with what is to date the best large-scale single-volume treatment of those crucial three days in July 1863, elegantly reconstructing the battle and the campaign from the perspectives of the participants. Trudeau allows them, from generals to enlisted men, to speak in their own words, creating a thoroughly absorbing story of determination on both sides and at all levels. Robert E. Lee began the campaign intending to win a battle of annihilation. July 1 inaugurated some of the hardest, and the most exacting, fighting American soldiers have ever done. The operational narratives are remarkable for their clarity, especially Trudeau's presentation of the confused fight for the Union left flank on July 2. The text is supplemented by sketch maps of unit positions and movements that are also models of clarity a particular boon to nonspecialist readers. Trudeau defensibly concludes that the wide latitude allowed subordinates at all levels of the Army of Northern Virginia worked against it at Gettysburg. Further, his emphasis on contemporary sources instead of postwar retrospection and academic analysis shows that despite nearly equal losses totaling almost 50,000 men Gettysburg failed as Lee's battle of annihilation.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Elizabeth and Her German Garden</h2><p>Elizabeth and Her German Garden is a novel by Elizabeth von Arnim, first published in 1898; it was very popular and frequently reprinted during the early years of the 20th century. The story is a year's diary written by the protagonist Elizabeth about her experiences learning gardening and interacting with her friends. It includes commentary on the beauty of nature and on society, but is primarily humorous due to Elizabeth's frequent mistakes and her idiosyncratic outlook on life. She looked down upon the frivolous fashions of her time writing &#x201c;I believe all needlework and dressmaking is of the devil, designed to keep women from study.&#x201d; The book is the first in a series about the same character. It is noteworthy for being published without a named author. Molesley lends a copy of this book to Anna on the 2nd episode of the 2nd season of Downton Abbey. In the novel The Shellseekers (1988) by Rosamunde Pilcher, Sophie reads Elizabeth von Arnim&#x2019;s "Elizabeth and her German Garden&#x201c;. In chapter 9 ("Sophie&#x201c;), Sophie says to Penelope: "[...] I always go back to it. It comforts me. Soothes me. It reminds me of a world that once existed and will exist again when the war has finished.&#x201c; In the novel The Gurnsey Potato Peel Pie and Literary Society, it is referred to by Elizabeth as having been the topic of discussion at the society meeting that she pretended had taken place on the night of the roast pork dinner. May 7th.--I love my garden. I am writing in it now in the late afternoon loveliness, much interrupted by the mosquitoes and the temptation to look at all the glories of the new green leaves washed half an hour ago in a cold shower.

The death of her father puts the teenage Elizabeth in greater peril, leaving her at the mercy of ambitious and unscrupulous men. Like her mother two decades earlier she is imprisoned in the Tower of London&#x2014;and fears she will also meet her mother&#x2019;s grisly end. Power-driven politics, private scandal and public gossip, a disputed succession, and the grievous example of her sister, &#x201c;Bloody&#x201d; Queen Mary, all cement Elizabeth&#x2019;s resolve in matters of statecraft and love, and set the stage for her transformation into the iconic Virgin Queen. <br><br> Alison Weir uses her deft talents as historian and novelist to exquisitely and suspensefully play out the conflicts between family, politics, religion, and conscience that came to define an age. Sweeping in scope, <i>The Lady Elizabeth </i>is a fascinating portrayal of a woman far ahead of her time&#x2014;an orphaned girl haunted by the shadow of the axe, an independent spirit who must use her cunning and wits for her very survival, and a future queen whose dangerous and dramatic path to the throne shapes her future greatness.</p><p>Alison Weir is the New York Times bestselling author of the novel Innocent Traitor, and several historical biographies, including Henry VIII, Eleanor of Aquitaine, The Life of Elizabeth, and The Six Wives of Henry VIII. She lives in Surrey, England with her husband and two children.CHAPTER 1<br><br>1536<br><br>On a hot, still morning in July, the Lady Mary, daughter to King Henry the Eighth, arrived at the great country palace of Hatfield, trotting into the courtyard on a white palfrey followed by four gentlemen, two ladies-in-waiting, and a female fool.<br><br>As soon as she had dismounted, she stooped to kiss the small girl who was waiting to greet her, whose nurse had just reminded her to sketch a wobbly curtsy to the older sister she had not seen for many months. The child was solemn-faced, fair-skinned, and freckled, with long tendrils of burnished red hair escaping from the embroidered white coif that was tied beneath her chin.<br><br>&#x201c;My, you have grown, sweeting!&#x201d; Mary exclaimed in her gruff voice, stroking Elizabeth&#x2019;s hair and straightening her silver pendant. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re nearly three now, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Elizabeth stared back, unsure of this richly dressed lady with the sad face and skinny body. Mary was not beautiful like Elizabeth&#x2019;s mother: Mary had a snub nose and a downturned mouth, and although her hair was red like Elizabeth&#x2019;s and their father&#x2019;s, it was thin and frizzy. And of course, Mary was very old&#x2014;all of twenty years, she had been told.<br><br>&#x201c;I have brought you gifts, Sister,&#x201d; Mary said, smiling and beckoning to a lady-in-waiting, who brought over a wooden box. Inside, wrapped in velvet, was a rosary of amber beads and a jeweled crucifix.<br><br>&#x201c;For your chapel,&#x201d; Mary said, pointing to the latter.<br><br>&#x201c;Pretty,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, gently fingering the beads.<br><br>&#x201c;How does my sister, Lady Bryan?&#x201d; Mary rose to her feet and greeted the governess with a kiss. &#x201c;And you yourself? It is good to see you again, but I would it were in happier circumstances.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I too, my Lady Mary. We are well enough, both of us, I thank you,&#x201d; the woman answered.<br><br>Elizabeth, watching them, was slightly discomfited by their words and curious at seeing a pained expression fleetingly shadow Mary&#x2019;s plain features.<br><br>&#x201c;I will speak with her presently,&#x201d; her sister said. Lady Bryan nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;I am grateful, Your Grace,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I pray you eat first, for it is nigh to eleven o&#x2019;clock and dinner is almost ready.&#x201d; Elizabeth was no longer listening; her attention had now focused on her new beads.<br><br>&#x201c;I have brought my fool, to afford a diversion later, if need be,&#x201d; Mary said, and Elizabeth&#x2019;s ears pricked up. She liked fools. They were funny.<br><br>While the roast goose and hot salad were being served with appropriate ceremony to Mary in the great hall, Elizabeth was sent to the nursery to have her dinner.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope Your Grace will excuse us,&#x201d; the nurse said to the Lady Mary. &#x201c;The Lady Elizabeth&#x2019;s Grace is too young as yet to eat with the grown- ups.&#x201d; After being pressed into another curtsy, the child was led away by the hand.<br><br>As soon as she had gone, Mary laid down her knife and shook her head sadly.<br><br>&#x201c;I hardly know how I am going to tell her, Margaret,&#x201d; she said miserably, looking to her former governess for support.<br><br>Lady Bryan rested a comforting hand on hers.<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be too explicit if I were you, Madam.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201d; agreed Mary fervently. &#x201c;Does she often speak of her mother? Do you think she will be much discomforted? After all, she cannot have seen much of her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid she did. Her Grace&#x2014;I mean the lady her mother&#x2014;kept the child with her, more than was seemly for a queen. If you remember, she even refused to have a wet nurse,&#x201d; Lady Bryan recalled with a sniff of disapproval.<br><br>Mary looked at her with mounting anxiety. She was dreading the coming confrontation.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think she will understand?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;There is much she understands,&#x201d; Lady Bryan replied. &#x201c;My lady is more than ordinarily precocious. As sharp as nails, that child, and clever with it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But a child for all that,&#x201d; Mary said, &#x201c;so I will break it to her as gently as I can, and may our Holy Mother and all the saints help me.&#x201d;<br><br>Seeing her so distressed, Lady Bryan sought to steer the conversation away from the subject, but while she and Sir John chattered on about household matters and the state of the weather, and while all of them toyed with their food, having little appetite for it, Mary, her heart swelling with love and compassion for her little sister, could only think of the heavy task that lay ahead of her.<br><br>Why should she feel this way? she asked herself. Why had she agreed to come here and perform this dreadful errand? Elizabeth&#x2019;s very existence had caused her untold pain and suffering, and it was because of Elizabeth&#x2019;s mother, that great whore, Anne Boleyn, that Mary had lost all that she held dear in life: her own mother, the late sainted Queen Katherine, her rank, her prospects of a throne and marriage, and the love of her father the King. Yet Mary had found nothing to resent in an innocent child, had in fact lavished all the love of which she was capable on the engaging little creature, and now, when the perilous twists of cruel fate had reversed Elizabeth&#x2019;s fortunes too, she could only grieve for the little girl.<br><br>As soon as the meal was finished, Elizabeth was brought back to her sister, and together they walked in the sun-browned park, away from the palace, their attendants following a short distance behind. The daystar was blazing down, there was barely the stir of a breeze, and the sisters were sweltering in their long-sleeved silk gowns; Elizabeth was glad of her wide-brimmed straw hat, which protected her face from the sunshine and the glare, while Mary, wearing a smart French hood with a band under the chin, was suffering decorously. Her lips were pursed, and she looked unhappy, Elizabeth noticed.<br><br>&#x201c;You have been much in my thoughts, Sister,&#x201d; Mary said. &#x201c;I had to come and see you, to satisfy myself that all was well with you, and . . .&#x201d; Her voice trailed away.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Sister,&#x201d; Elizabeth replied. Again, Mary caressed the long red curls that fanned out beneath the sun hat; again, she looked unutterably sad. Young as she was, the child could sense her misery.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; Elizabeth asked. &#x201c;Why are you unhappy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, my dear Sister,&#x201d; Mary cried, sinking to her knees on the grass and embracing Elizabeth tightly. Elizabeth struggled free. She did not like to be squeezed like that; she was a self-contained child. Yet Mary did not notice, for she was weeping. Elizabeth could see Lady Bryan watching them intently, standing a little way off with Mary&#x2019;s ladies and the nursemaids, and she was puzzled as to why her governess did not hasten to her rescue.<br><br>&#x201c;Come, Sister,&#x201d; Mary was saying, sniffing and dabbing her eyes with a white kerchief. &#x201c;Let us sit here.&#x201d; She drew Elizabeth to a stone seat that had been placed in the shade of an oak tree to afford those who rested there a grand view of the red-brick palace spread out beyond the formal gardens, and lifted the child onto it.<br><br>&#x201c;I am charged by our father to tell you something that will make you very sad,&#x201d; Mary said. &#x201c;You must be a brave girl . . . as I too have had to be brave in my time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am brave,&#x201d; Elizabeth assured her, none too confidently, wondering fearfully what this was all about.<br><br>Nothing had changed outwardly&#x2014;her daily routine had remained the same, and the people in her household still curtsied to her and treated her with deference. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for something her governor had said, she would not have realized there was anything untoward. But she was a sharp child, and the change of title did not go unnoticed.<br><br>&#x201c;Why, governor,&#x201d; she had asked Sir John Shelton, in her clear, well- modulated voice, &#x201c;why is it that yesterday you called me Lady Princess, and today just Lady Elizabeth?&#x201d;<br><br>Caught off guard, Sir John Shelton had pulled at his luxuriant chestnut beard, frowned, and hesitated, while Elizabeth stood before him, her steely gaze imperiously demanding a response. Not for the first time, he was struck by this regal quality in her, which in his opinion was unsuited to the female condition but would have been admirable in a prince, the prince that England so desperately needed.<br><br>&#x201c;The King your father has ordered it,&#x201d; he said carefully.<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; asked the child, her dark eyes narrowing.<br><br>&#x201c;The King&#x2019;s orders must always be obeyed,&#x201d; he declared.<br><br>The little face clouded, the lips pouting, the brows furrowing. Sir John had sidestepped the question, but Elizabeth was determined not to let him off so easily. At that moment, mercifully for him, Lady Bryan entered the room. Always immaculate in her dark velvet gowns, with never a hair nor any detail of dress out of place, she had been ruling her army of nursemaids, servants, and household officers with quiet authority since her royal charge had been given her own establishment at the age of three months.<br><br>Lady Bryan was carrying a pile of freshly laundered linen strewn with herbs, heading for the carved chest that stood at the foot of Elizabeth&#x2019;s bed. Seeing Sir John, who had overall charge of the household, she dipped a neat curtsy without in any way sacrificing her dignity, then bent to her task. But Elizabeth was tugging at her skirts. Surely her governess, who knew everything, would tell her the answer to her question.<br><br>&#x201c;My lady,&#x201d; she pleaded, &#x201c;I have asked Sir John why he called me Lady Princess yesterday, and Lady Elizabeth today. Why is that?&#x201d;<br><br>Elizabeth was stunned to see tears well up in her governess&#x2019;s eyes. Lady Bryan, who was always so calm, so composed, so in control&#x2014;was she<br><br>really about to cry? She, who was always instructing Elizabeth that a lady never betrayed her feelings, never laughed too loudly or gave way to tears. It was unimaginable, and thus shocking. But perhaps she had imagined it, for when she looked again, Lady Bryan was perfectly in command of herself.<br><br>&#x201c;You have a new title, my Lady Elizabeth,&#x201d; she said, in a voice that was clearly meant to reassure. &#x201c;The King&#x2019;s Highness has decreed it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But why?&#x201d; persisted the child. She had a sense of things hidden from her . . .<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure the King has very good reasons,&#x201d; answered Lady Bryan in a tone that forbade further discussion. &#x201c;Now, where are those dolls you were playing with earlier?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I put them to bed,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, plainly not interested.<br><br>&#x201c;In the morning? The very idea!&#x201d; exclaimed her governess. &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;ve got some pretty silks in my basket, and some scraps of Holland cloth. Go and fetch your best doll, and I&#x2019;ll help you to make a cap for her.&#x201d;<br><br>Elizabeth toddled reluctantly to the miniature cradle by her bed. It was clear that the answers to her questions would not be forthcoming.<br><br>Elizabeth often sat with her governess, being taught the things that all well-brought-up little girls needed to know. They might look at the vivid pictures in one of the beautifully illuminated books that the King had provided, or sort through embroidery silks, Lady Bryan allowing the child to pick the colors herself. Then she would teach Elizabeth how to make rows of different stitches. Elizabeth learned this quickly, as she learned everything. Already, she knew her alphabet, and her numbers up to one hundred, and in chapel she was already striving to understand the Latin rubric of the Mass.<br><br>&#x201c;What is Father Matthew saying?&#x201d; she would pipe up, ever inquisitive, and Lady Bryan would put a finger to her lips and explain patiently, murmuring in a low voice. Afterward, Elizabeth would pester the chaplain, urging him to teach her the words and phrases that so intrigued her.<br><br>&#x201c;I do declare that my Lady Princess has the gift of languages,&#x201d; he told Sir John Shelton and Lady Bryan, and indeed he appeared to be right, for Elizabeth had just to hear a thing said once and she had it by heart.<br><br>When the embroidering palled&#x2014;after all, Elizabeth was only in her third year, and her quick, darting mind was always flitting on to the next thing&#x2014;Lady Bryan would see to it that her day was filled with distractions: a walk in the great wide park of Hatfield, a visit to the stables to see her dappled pony, or a spell in the kitchens to watch the cook making marchpane, which she was allowed to sample after it had cooled; the child had an inordinately sweet tooth. Then a story&#x2014;nothing too somber, but perhaps that old tale of Master Chaucer&#x2019;s about Chanticleer the cock, which always made Elizabeth laugh out loud; and after this, a light supper of pottage and bread, then prayers and bedtime.<br><br>Once Elizabeth was settled in her comfortable bed, with its feather mattress, crisp heavy linen, rich velvet counterpane and curtains, and the arms of England embroidered on its tester, Lady Bryan would sign the cross on her forehead then leave her to go to sleep, settling herself with a book in a high-backed chair by the fire, a candle flickering at her side. The room would be warm, and soon she herself would be slumbering, her book abandoned on her lap.<br><br>Elizabeth, however, would lie wide awake, her fertile mind active, puzzling over the mysteries and marvels of her life . . .<br><br>Her earliest memories were of her father. Her big, magnificent father, King Harry the Eighth, the most wonderful being in the world. It was Elizabeth&#x2019;s greatest grief that she did not see him very often. The rare occasions on which he visited her at Hatfield were the most exciting days of all. God-like in his rich velvets and furs, his jewels and chains, he would chuck her under the chin, then swing her up in the air and whirl her around, she shrieking with delight, her beribboned cap askew and her long red tresses flying.<br><br>&#x201c;How does my little Bessy?&#x201d; he would inquire. &#x201c;Are they keeping you hard at your books and your prayers, or do they let you out to play as often as they should?&#x201d; And he would wink conspiratorially, so that Elizabeth could know that it was all right to say yes, she did spend a lot of time playing, and that she loved the latest doll or toy he had sent her.<br><br>&#x201c;But I do learn my letters, sir, and my catechism,&#x201d; she would tell him.<br><br>&#x201c;Well and good, well and good,&#x201d; he would say, pulling her onto his wide lap and sitting her on strong muscular thighs, with her cheek against the brilliant rough surface of his doublet, which was encrusted with gems and goldsmiths&#x2019; work. She would breathe in the wholesome smell of him, a smell of herbs, musky perfume, and the great outdoors, and nestle against him, enjoying the sensation of his bristly red beard tickling the top of her forehead.<br><br>&#x201c;I will tell you something, Bessy,&#x201d; he said once. &#x201c;When I was a young king, I did not wish to be at my prayers or attending to state affairs; I wanted to enjoy life. So can you guess what I did? I would sneak out of the palace by a back stair and go hunting, and my councillors would never know I had gone.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Water Dragon&#39;s Bride, Vol. 9 (9)</h2><p>A modern-day girl gets whisked away to a strange land where she is sacrificed to a water dragon god!<br><br>In the blink of an eye, a modern-day girl named Asahi is whisked away from her warm and happy home and stranded in a strange and mysterious world where she meets a water dragon god!<br> <br>Kurose and the god of darkness conspire to take control of the emperor of Naga&#x2019;s throne, and they have no qualms about using Asahi to do it!

Arguably the most impressive collection of international relations scholars ever brought together within one volume, the <em>Handbook </em>debates the nature of the field itself, critically engages with the major theories, surveys a wide spectrum of methods, addresses the relationship between scholarship and policy making, and examines the field's relation with cognate disciplines. The <em>Handbook</em> takes as its central themes the interaction between empirical and normative inquiry that permeates all theorizing in the field and the way in which contending approaches have shaped one another.

What they could not foresee was that, with the digital revolution and the pervasive automation associated with it, the developments they had discerned would be greatly accentuated, giving rise to the loss of reason and to the loss of the reason for living. Individuals are now overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of digital information and the speed of digital flows, resulting in a kind of technological Wild West in which they find themselves increasingly powerless, driven by their lack of agency to the point of madness.</p> <p>How can we find a way out of this situation? In this major new book, Bernard Stiegler argues that we must first acknowledge our era as one of fundamental disruption and detachment. We are living in an absence of&nbsp;<i>epokh&#x113;</i>&nbsp;in the philosophical sense, by which Stiegler means that we have lost our path of thinking and being. Weaving in powerful accounts from his own life story, including struggles with depression and time spent in prison, Stiegler calls for a new&nbsp;<i>epokh&#x113;</i>&nbsp;based on public power. We must forge new circuits of meaning outside of the established algorithmic routes. For only then will forms of thinking and life be able to arise that restore meaning and aspiration to the individual.</p> <p>Concluding with a dialogue between Stiegler and Jean-Luc Nancy, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars in social and cultural theory, media and cultural studies, philosophy and the humanities generally.</p></p><p><p><b>Bernard Stiegler</b> is Founder and Director of the Institut de recherche et d&#x2019;innovation (IRI) at the Centre Georges-Pompidou.</p><p>&#x2018;A summation of his thinking to date &#x2013; from originary technicity to the Anthropocene &#x2013; this is also Stiegler's most personal philosophical work so far. Discussing his intellectual apprenticeship while in prison, and his practice of thinking and writing as a form of self-medication against depression and madness, he issues a passionate call to tend the wounds of contemporary existence, whether psychological, economic or ecological, through the collective transformation of the wilful destruction indulged in by our digital superpowers into a future worth wanting to live for.&#x2019;<br><b>Martin Crowley, University of Cambridge<br><br></b>"[I]ntricate and brilliant . . . enunciated by a humane and compassionate voice."<br><i><b>Los Angeles Review of Books</b></i></p></p><h2>Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt</h2><p>This book is a vivid reconstruction of the practical aspects of ancient Egyptian religion.

From Hungary to Germany to the United States, they remained friends and continued to work together and influence each other throughout their lives. As a result, their work was integral to some of the most important scientific and political developments of the twentieth century.<br> Istv�n Hargittai tells the story of this remarkable group: Wigner won a Nobel Prize in theoretical physics; Szilard was the first to see that a chain reaction based on neutrons was possible, initiated the Manhattan Project, but left physics to try to restrict nuclear arms; von Neumann could solve difficult problems in his head and developed the modern computer for more complex problems; von K�rm�n became the first director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, providing the scientific basis for the U.S. Air Force; and Teller was the father of the hydrogen bomb, whose name is now synonymous with the controversial "Star Wars" initiative of the 1980s. Each was fiercely opinionated, politically active, and fought against all forms of totalitarianism.<br> Hargittai, as a young Hungarian physical chemist, was able to get to know some of these great men in their later years, and the depth of information and human interest in The Martians of Science is the result of his personal relationships with the subjects, their families, and their contemporaries. <br><br></p><p><br><strong>Istv�n Hargittai</strong> is Professor of Chemistry and head of the George A.

Based on a detailed study of 35 cases in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and post-communist Eurasia, this book explores the fate of competitive authoritarian regimes between 1990 and 2008. It finds that where social, economic, and technocratic ties to the West were extensive, as in Eastern Europe and the Americas, the external cost of abuse led incumbents to cede power rather than crack down, which led to democratization. Where ties to the West were limited, external democratizing pressure was weaker and countries rarely democratized. In these cases, regime outcomes hinged on the character of state and ruling party organizations. Where incumbents possessed developed and cohesive coercive party structures, they could thwart opposition challenges, and competitive authoritarian regimes survived; where incumbents lacked such organizational tools, regimes were unstable but rarely democratized.</p><p>Competitive authoritarian regimes - in which autocrats submit to meaningful multiparty elections but engage in serious democratic abuse - proliferated in the post-Cold War era.

This book takes the reader inside some of Samuel's groundbreaking and inspiring interiors, beginning with his first job assisting St�phane Boudin of Jansen in the 1920s through postwar Paris society and into the go-go '80s. During his illustrious career, Samuel created rarefied and beautiful environments for his jet-set clientele--Doris Duke, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, Susan and John Gutfreund, Valentino Garavani, and multiple Rothschilds and Vanderbilts. Such was his expertise that museums such as Versailles and the Metropolitan Museum of Art consulted him on the installation of period rooms. Samuel was a master at reproducing intimate spaces in various historic styles in addition to mixing those styles in an erudite way: modernist paintings were installed over Empire consoles, Louis XIII furniture shared space with Oriental objects, neoclassical chairs were placed beside tables of brass and Plexiglas.<br><br>This book records Samuel's life, his career, and the luxurious interiors he created for his clients and himself--rooms that look as fresh and alive today as they did when they were first arranged.

(Paperback))</h2><p><p>A richly imagined and stunningly inventive literary masterpiece of love, art, and betrayal, exploring the genesis of evil, the unforeseen consequences of love, and the ultimate unreliability of storytelling itself.</p><p>Paris in the 1920s shimmers with excitement, dissipation, and freedom. It is a place of intoxicating ambition, passion, art, and discontent, where louche jazz venues like the Chameleon Club draw expats, artists, libertines, and parvenus looking to indulge their true selves. It is at the Chameleon where the striking Lou Villars, an extraordinary athlete and scandalous cross-dressing lesbian, finds refuge among the club&#x2019;s loyal denizens, including the rising Hungarian photographer Gabor Tsenyi, the socialite and art patron Baroness Lily de Rossignol; and the caustic American writer Lionel Maine.</p><p>As the years pass, their fortunes&#x2014;and the world itself&#x2014;evolve. Lou falls desperately in love and finds success as a race car driver. Gabor builds his reputation with startlingly vivid and imaginative photographs, including a haunting portrait of Lou and her lover, which will resonate through all their lives. As the exuberant twenties give way to darker times, Lou experiences another metamorphosis&#x2014;sparked by tumultuous events&#x2014;that will warp her earnest desire for love and approval into something far more.</p></p><p>Francine Prose <p><b></b></p> <b>Francine Prose Explains the Genesis of Lovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932</b> <p></p> <p>Lovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932 began with a Brassai photograph I saw at a museum show in Washington. I was familiar with the photo, &#x201c;Lesbian Couple at Le Monocle, 1932&#x201d;: a portrait of two women sitting at a table in a bar, one in a sparkly evening gown, the other in drag, with short hair and a tuxedo. But the wall text said something I hadn&#x2019;t known, which was that the woman in the tuxedo, a professional athlete named Violette Morris, had worked for the Gestapo during the German occupation of Paris and later been assassinated by the French Resistance. </p> <p>A little research turned up an even more interesting story. Morris was an Olympic hopeful and a professional auto racer. When her license to compete as an athlete was revoked by the French government, as punishment for being a public cross-dresser, Hitler somehow got wind of it, and invited Morris to be his special guest at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. By the time she got back to France, she was not only spying for the Germans, but she was the person who told them where the Maginot Line ended: where they could breach the French defenses. During the Occupation, she did indeed work for the Nazis, and was killed by the Resistance in 1944. </p> <p>It was such an amazing story that I considered writing it as nonfiction, but I soon decided that I would have more liberty, and that I and my readers would have a lot more fun, if I wrote it as a novel. As the process went on, the novel became less linear, and about all sorts of things besides Violette Morris (in the novel named Lou Villars). Moving back twenty years from the date of her death, I found myself writing about Paris in the &#x2018;20s, and using several different voices. Gabor, the photographer, is writing letters home to his parents in Hungary, as did Brassai. An American, Lionel Maine, is writing a novel/memoir about expatriate life, a little like Henry Miller. There are several other faux-memoirs, some &#x201c;published,&#x201d; some not, one by a baroness, one by Gabor&#x2019;s wife. And Lou&#x2019;s story comes to us in the form of a life history by her &#x201c;biographer,&#x201d; Nathalie Dunois, a teacher at a regional high school, who cannot seem to separate her own life and her own problems from her subject&#x2019;s. Hitler and Picasso make cameo appearances. </p> <p>Each person has his or her version of the truth about the bright and glorious days of Paris in the &#x2018;20s, the theatrical spectacle and intrigue of Berlin in the &#x2018;30s, and the darker era that began when those two worlds came together. As always, the novel ended in a very different place from where it began. I started off writing about a woman in a tuxedo and wound up writing about art, love, evil, money, auto racing, espionage, insomnia, seduction and betrayal&#x2014;and the way that history changes, depending on who tells it.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <br> <p><b></b></p> <p></p><p>Scandalized and celebrated by Parisian society, Lou Villars is an extraordinary athlete who is confident that one day she will be an inspiration for her gender. She's also a lesbian and cross-dresser who finds a safe haven in the Chameleon Club, a louche nightspot.</p><p>As the exuberant 1920s give way to the depression of the 1930s, Lou abandons her work as a server and performer at the Chameleon Club to become a talented race-car driver, hovering on the brink of success. She falls in love with a German driver, Inge, and is soon ensnared in a web of flattery and lies that will warp her earnest desire for love and approval into something far more sinister: collaboration with the Nazis.</p><p>Told in a kaleidoscope of voices, <em>Lovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932</em> evokes Paris with brio, humor, and intimacy. A brilliant work of fiction and a mesmerizing read, it is Francine Prose's finest novel yet.</p></p><h2>Secrets in the Attic</h2><p><i>From the imagination behind <i>Flowers in the Attic</i> comes a sensational new novel that spins a seductive web between fantasies and lies -- and uncovers the price for keeping</i> <br> <b><br>Secrets in the Attic<br></b> <br>Two Friends As Close As Sisters.<br> <br>One Killer Secret That<br> <br>Will Tear Their Small Town Apart.<br> <br> In the dust and shadows of the attic, they shared everything -- fanciful stories, high school crushes, plans for the future, dreams to travel the world.

Working from government reports, manuscripts, and the diaries and letters of those persons&#x2014;both white and Indian&#x2014;who knew him, Margaret Coel has developed an unusually readable, interesting, and closely documented account of his life and the life of his tribe during the fateful years of the mid-1800s.</p><p>It was in these years that thousands of gold-seekers on their way to California and Oregon burst across the plains, first to traverse the territory consigned to the Indians and then, with the discovery of gold in 1858 on Little Dry Creek (formerly the site of the Southern Arapaho winter campground&nbsp; and presently Denver, Colorado), to settle.</p><p>Chief Left Hand was one of the first of his people to acknowledge the inevitability of the white man&#x2019;s presence on the plain, and thereafter to espouse a policy of adamant peacefulness &#x2014;if not, finally, friendship&#x2014;toward the newcomers.</p><p><i>Chief Left Hand</i> is not only a consuming story&#x2014;popular history at its best&#x2014;but an important work of original scholarship.

Evans, first governor of Colorado, in the Sand Creek Massacre. Colonel Chivington, commander of the Colorado Volunteers, has always (and justly) been held responsible for the surprise attack. But Governor Evans, who afterwards claimed ignorance and innocence of the colonel&#x2019;s intentions, was also deeply involved. His letters, on file in the Colorado State Archives, have somehow escaped the scrutiny of historians and remain, for the most part, unpublished. These Coel has used extensively, allowing the governor to tell, in his own words, his real role in the massacre. The author also examines Evans&#x2019;s motivations for coming to Colorado, his involvement with the building of the transcontinental railroad, and his intention of clearing the Southern Arapahos from the plains &#x2014;an intention that abetted Chivington&#x2019;s ambitions and led to their ruthless slaughter at Sand Creek.</li></ul></p><p><p><strong>Margaret Coel</strong>, a fourth-generation Coloradan, has spent four years researching primary source material in the libraries and archives across the plains, as well as in Washington, D.

Why, then, did the Roman Catholic Church feel obliged to almost entirely erase this female figure and her role? Was it because of a now proven anti-feminism that existed at the heart of the Church from the early Middle Ages? The Christian conception of femininity, which has certainly greatly evolved in the modern world, especially since the council of Vatican II, is due both to Greco-Roman legacy and to the Hebraic options. With the exception of the female characters of Genesis, who are gripping figures to say the least, the scribes of the Bible lowered the status of Woman by making her impure and thus not apt, for example, to play a sacerdotal role. The idea that Mary Magdalene enjoyed total equality with the apostles has never crossed the minds of Church theologians. Because priests are the legitimate heirs of the apostles, such a standing would make Mary Magdalene, on the one hand, a priestess--how horrible!--and on the other, one of those on whom the apostolic sacerdotal filiation was founded. <br> <br>Yet, when Mary of Bethany washes Jesus&#x2019; feet and anoints him with precious perfume, which Judas, the group&#x2019;s treasurer, believes could be put to a more profitable use, she and Jesus are enacting a kind of sacerdotal and royal ordination--with Mary serving as the priestess who performs the ritual. <br> <br>Is it forbidden to think that Mary of Bethany, over the course of those long moments spent at the feet of the Lord, could have heard what he had to say or at least sensed the full scope of Christ&#x2019;s mystery even if she did not grasp it in its entirety? Jesus persistently tried to lead his disciples to realize this--if only in the &#x98ec;at of the Transfiguration!--but their hearts remained curiously closed all the way to the end. Mary, however, did perceive and accept it. On that day she knew the moment had come to manifest this mystery in chiaroscuro. In a kind of prophetic intuition . . . Mary anointed the head of Jesus, recognizing and presenting him as King and Priest, and anointed his feet as Messiah sent from God. <br> <br>Such a presentation obviously involves a rite of enthronement that can be performed only by a person vested symbolically with sacerdotal powers. Jesus was fully aware of this when he answered Martha&#x2019;s reproaches by saying that Mary &#x201c;had the best part.&#x201d; <br> <br>At that time there were two sites named Bethany: a town two miles east of Jerusalem, where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived; and on the left bank of the Jordan, at a ford just before the Dead Sea, where John the Baptist baptized. In addition, there was a place called Bethabara, &#x201c;house of passage,&#x201d; by the gates to the desert. John the Baptist and later Mary, each in their own way, granted baptism, initiation, the right of passage, or the means of crossing the threshold. The two Bethanys, then, seem to mirror each other. Magdalene extends the echo of her precursor, John the Baptist. One is a man clad in hides and the other is a woman clad in her long mane of hair. The chief difference between them is that John remains in a harsh and terrible place, screaming in Essenian rigor his curses and his calls to repent, whereas Mary in Bethany, on the opposite where all is blooming and gay, speaks of love and forgiveness and the transition from one world to the next. While Jesus received from John a baptism in water, he did not receive, as the ancient kings had, a consecrating anointing with oil. Just before his Passion and &#x201c;baptism by spirit and fire&#x201d;--the crucifixion--he received the perfumed oil from the female Magdalene. The old and ancient notion of the priest-king applies to Jesus, but this royal unction, let me repeat, can only be performed by a priest--or priestess. <br> <br>The unction in Bethany is surely one of the most important events in the life of Jesus. Furthermore, this is what Jesus himself says to his disciples who are always more or less hostile toward the whims of Woman: He declares to them that this woman truly did &#x201c;what she had to do,&#x201d; and even adds, according to Mark 14:9, &#x201c;In truth, I declare to you, everywhere the Gospel is to be spread, throughout the whole world, one will also recount, in memory of her, the deed she has done.&#x201d; This is acknowledgment of an uncommon power possessed by Mary that went far beyond a mere gesture of female vanity, which is clearly what the first disciples thought it to be, and underscores the importance Magdalene was given in the very words of Jesus. <br> <br>Why, then, was Mary Magdalene relegated to such a minor role in the evangelical tradition as revised and corrected by the Church Fathers? Is the Christian sacerdotal class ashamed to owe so much to a woman? <br> <br>And I cannot forbear from asking myself: what has the memory of the Church done to these words of Jesus? Isn&#x2019;t there something yet to be explored there? And wouldn&#x2019;t this something be the consecration of a specifically female ministry of a prophetic and charismatic nature that Jesus would himself have recognized and proclaimed as existing in tandem with the apostolic and sacerdotal ministry? What a unique place woman would hold in the very heart of the Church if this was the case! <br> <br>The question certainly has been raised--and it seems that Abbe Sauni&#x8ca5; may have answered it in his own way in the church of Rennes-le-Chateau.</p><h2>Piano Pieces for the Adult Beginner, No. 251</h2><p>(Music Sales America).

His introduction helps children to see the Chinese workers, gathered in a shack after their day of "hot, grueling work," telling stories to pass the time before sleep comes. Each section is prefaced by a short explanation of how the tales might relate to the Chinese-American experience. Yep retells the stories simply and directly, attempting to use his own voice while preserving the "spirit and spare beauty" of the original tales. He does this by weaving bits of rich description into short, clear telling. The tales, while drawn from and depicting Chinese culture, present a variety of familiar motifs and types: wizards and saints, shape changing and magical objects, pourquoi tales and lessons. An "Afterword" provides suggestions for further reading on Chinese folktales. This is an excellent introduction to Chinese and Chinese-American folklore that reads aloud well, that will provide little-known tales for telling, and that is simple enough for older children to read by themselves. --Constance A.

This man, I knew in my gut, was <i>it.</i> I finally understood what it meant, when you &#x201c;just know.&#x201d; I just knew about Marco. I met him at the Square, the restaurant where we both worked. I got a job as a waitress to make the money that did not seem to be materializing from my acting and modeling careers. Two years out of college, I had quit my job as an analyst at a hedge fund and decided to become a full-time actor, to &#x201c;go for it.&#x201d; It sounded great in theory.</p><p>A year later, I&#x2019;d gone to audition after audition, casting after casting, and the biggest job I had booked was starring in a holiday vodka commercial. The role called for &#x201c;blonde, pretty, aspirational, Swedish-looking.&#x201d; Check, and apparently check, check, check. A whole twenty seconds of staring dreamily into the eyes of the chiseled-faced man I had met a few hours before and clinking my glass against his. Having a restaurant job to pay the bills made me a clich�, but it was necessary, and besides, it gave the days structure.</p><p>On the first day of training at the Square, a trendy burger restaurant a few blocks from my apartment, I sat with ten other new employees around a large, circular table, listening to Bruce, the tiny, energetic manager go over the corporate &#x201c;steps of service.&#x201d; It was my second waitressing job&#x2014;the first, a chain restaurant in midtown (the only place that would hire me with no experience) lasted just two months. As Bruce danced around the restaurant, demonstrating when to bring steak knives versus butter knives to a table, I scanned the faces around the table, landing on dark brown eyes belonging to one of the bartenders. He was tall and Latin with black, slicked back hair and mocha skin. Judging by his accent when he asked a question about the bar setup a few moments earlier, he had been born elsewhere but had lived in the States awhile; the way he spoke was confident and fluid. Our eyes briefly locked and he gave a quick, easy smile. I looked away, willing myself not to blush. I had learned long ago that the best way to survive in New York City was to keep my defenses up at all times. And anyway, I was happy with my long-distance boyfriend back home in Maine. Jeff had light blue eyes, curly brown hair, and a build comprised of the muscles he used every day in his construction job. When I saw him without clothes, it was like seeing a Greek god in the flesh. I had never seen a body like that in real life before. I had met Jeff while I was home for the summer helping my mom recover from surgery. When I went back to New York at the end of the summer, we substituted drunken nights on his couch for hours on the phone, and what was supposed to be a fun summer fling somehow turned into a year-long romance. Our relationship of texting and sporadic weekend visits was easy, and he made me laugh.</p><p>The meeting ended, and I gathered my notebook and pen and slid my sunglasses up to rest on top of my head. I was almost through the doors leading to the street before anyone else had even gotten up from the table. I felt someone come up right behind me and suddenly the door was opening. It was the Latin.</p><p>&#x201c;Jen, right?&#x201d; Except the way he said it, it sounded like &#x201c;Gin.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Um, right. Sorry, I was just&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Marco, the bar manager. Bruce asked me to hand out these employee packets to everyone at the end of the meeting, but you ran away before I could give you one,&#x201d; he said, passing me some rolled up sheets of paper.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sorry, I was just . . . thanks.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t help but meet his open face with a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re obviously in a hurry,&#x201d; he said with a wink and then walked away before I could respond.</p><p>The next day at work we did speed drills at the bar to see how quickly the bartenders could churn out drinks during a rush. </p><p>&#x201c;Send three drinks on different tickets, right now, bam, bam, bam,&#x201d; Bruce whispered to me and rubbed his hands together. I put in the order for three drinks.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, a jalape�o margarita for . . . Gin,&#x201d; Marco said as he read the first bar ticket. My face flushed with color. The next ticket printed. &#x201c;And a mojito for . . . Gin,&#x201d; </p><p>Marco said with a half-smile. I smiled back as the third ticket printed. &#x201c;Martini straight up with a twist. Wait. Don&#x2019;t tell me,&#x201d; he scrunched his face up, &#x201c;For Gin!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; I laughed, walking over to the bar. &#x201c;Bruce made me,&#x201d; I whispered when I got close enough.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be sorry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;At least I have something nice to look at while I make these drinks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh. Ha,&#x201d; I said and forced myself to breathe in and out steadily through my nose.</p><p>On the last night of training, before the restaurant opened to the friends and family of the owners the next day, everyone decided to go for a drink at the dive bar two blocks away. I finished my side work and walked to the bathroom to change out of my black&nbsp;uniform.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you coming to Doyle&#x2019;s, Gin?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked up to see Marco walking toward me with his small work duffel bag in hand.&#x201c;Umm . . . yeah. I just have to change.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wait for you at the bar. Everyone else already left,&#x201d; he said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, OK . . . I&#x2019;ll be right out.&#x201d; My heart pounded as I quickly pulled on skinny jeans and a loose T-shirt.</p><p>I walked back through the main room of the restaurant. Marco was waiting by the big glass doors.</p><p>&#x201c;After you.&#x201d; Marco held the door open, and we walked through. </p><p>&#x201c;Who said chivalry is dead,&#x201d; I said with a small smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s my Latin charm. It&#x2019;s been bred into me over generations and generations,&#x201d; he said seriously.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, really, is that so?&#x201d; When our shoulders touched for an instant on the way to Doyle&#x2019;s, I momentarily stopped breathing.</p><p>At the bar, we settled in with our coworkers. I sat down next to Andrew, a server with a gleaming bald head and oversize bright white teeth, who immediately began telling me about his relation- ship troubles with his current boyfriend. Marco ordered two vodka sodas and placed one in front of me. &#x201c;Double vodka soda for Gin.&#x201d; His smile swept over me. As he walked to the other side of the table, I thought, <i>I am going to marry that man.</i> It was a quick, involuntary thought, and I recoiled as soon as it had passed through my mind. I took a long drink through the straw in front of me and focused on the cool liquid sliding down my throat.</p><p>For the next hour I talked and joked with Andrew and Karly, another blonde waitress. I&#x2019;d always thought Karly was icy, but after two beers she melted into a sweet, goofy girl from California. Karly confessed she put on a &#x201c;bitch face&#x201d; to fend off advances from the bussers who seemed particularly drawn to her even though she hovered almost a foot above them. I was aware of Marco sitting across the small table from me the entire time, and even though we were both involved in separate conversations, I felt myself speaking every word and making each gesture only for him. As the double vodka soda settled into my bones, loosening my limbs and flushing my cheeks, I pressed my knee into his under the table. For half a second, there was nothing. And then I felt it. A slight returned pressure. Neither of us acknowledged what was happening under the table, and it went unnoticed by all our coworkers.</p><p>When everyone else said their good-byes around 2:00 a.m., I turned to Marco, &#x201c;Are you sure you ordered me a double? It was a little weak.&#x201d; Instead of leaving with the others, he grinned and made his way to the bar saying, &#x201c;In that case, I better get you another drink or you&#x2019;ll leave dissatisfied, and we wouldn&#x2019;t want that.&#x201d; Karly paused at the door, &#x201c;Are y&#x2019;all coming?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, we&#x2019;re gonna have one more. See you tomorrow!&#x201d;</p><p><i>Pull up</i>, a voice whispered in my head. Instead I took a large gulp of the drink Marco had just set in front of me. </p><p>He wanted to know everything about me. There was something about the way Marco looked at me, his eyes were so intense, like I was the only person in the bar. I told him about growing up in a small town on the coast of Maine. My childhood filled with sandy beaches and freezing cold water that gave me ice cream headaches when I dunked (but I always dunked anyway) and playing tag at night with the neighborhood kids. I told him about my parents. How they were the parents that my friends wished were their own parents: affectionate, warm, and funny but also just strict enough. My mom worked her way up the corporate ladder as a manager at L.L.Bean, and my dad was a computer engineer. I told Marco about the moment my dad announced that he had quit his job to start his own company. How, even as an eleven-year-old, I knew it was something special and something to be proud of, but the uncertainty made me nervous. After his first two start-ups failed, we saw less and less of him as he worked longer and longer hours. My mom started getting migraine headaches. There was a tension in our house that had never been there before. And then, after four years and three failed start-ups, my parents brought my sister and me into the dining room and told us to look at the newspaper lying on the kitchen table. The tiny little blurb circled in pen read, &#x201c;Cimaron Snapped up by AMCC.&#x201d; My sister and I shrieked in delight. My father&#x2019;s start-up had been bought by a larger company&#x2014;we were never told the details, but after that morning, the tension in our house dissipated.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not usually in the habit of revealing much about my childhood, but when Marco looked at me, he saw me, who I really was, and my self-consciousness evaporated. His questions came one after another, and, when I got to the part about my long- distance boyfriend, I blushed but plowed on. Marco just smiled and started talking. He told me about growing up in Argentina, about his grandfather&#x2019;s house in the countryside where he would go for the summer and take care of his grandfather&#x2019;s bunnies (only much, much later would he confess that many of those bunnies ended up on their dinner plates), about his trip to the United States with his mother, father, and older sister when he was eighteen. The trip that changed his life. They came for a family vacation after his graduation from military high school. After spending a week in New York City as a tourist who spoke five words of English, he fell in love with the excitement and energy of the city and refused to board the plane back home. It was a split second decision that resulted in a brand-new life in a foreign country and the most exciting city in the world. Then, five years later, when he was just twenty-three and had worked his way up from a busser, to a server, to a bartender, and had become fluent in English, he got his Polish girlfriend pregnant. The girlfriend left him when the baby was a year old, and he had stayed in New York to be close to his son. He had begged her to try to make it work for their new family, but she had already moved on to someone else. She gave him a week to get out of their apartment so her new boyfriend could move in. That was seven years ago.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never told anyone those details before,&#x201d; he said slowly, looking up from his hands.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry. That&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d; I reached out and touched his arm.</p><p>I wanted to know everything about him, but in the next moment, he cleared his throat and smiled, &#x201c;I think they&#x2019;re closing up. You better finish your drink.&#x201d;</p><p>I leaned forward to take in the last of the vodka soda through the straw.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d; &#x201c;Do what?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Lean over like that.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked down to see cleavage, a lot of cleavage. &#x201c;On that note . . . it&#x2019;s probably time for me to go home.&#x201d;</p><p>Marco walked me home, and we hugged in front of my building. When our bodies pressed together, electricity coursed through my body.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I think you better go inside right now,&#x201d; Marco said with a laugh. </p><p>&#x201c;Because if you don&#x2019;t get out of my sight soon, I might try to kiss you. And I don&#x2019;t want to embarrass myself.&#x201d;</p><p>My cheeks flushed with pleasure. </p><p>&#x201c;Good night, Marco.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good night, Gin.&#x201d; </p></p><h2>Den of Wolves (Blackthorn &amp; Grim)</h2><p><b>The enchanting fantasy series from the award-winning author of the Sevenwaters novels continues, as embittered healer Blackthorn and her companion, Grim, struggle to fulfill the rules of her bond to the fey.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </b><br><br>Despite her personal struggles, Blackthorn agrees to help take care of a troubled young girl who has recently been brought to court, while Grim is sent to the girl&#x2019;s home at Wolf Glen to aid her wealthy father with a strange task&#x2014;repairing a broken-down house deep in the woods.

He'd forgotten how bright the moon was, how its light could go right through a man, cold in his bones, searching out what was hidden deep. Go away, he breathes, arms up over his head, knees to his chest, trying to be invisible. Leave me alone. But the light seeks him out, finding a way through the high canopy of the beeches, through the rough blanket of bracken and fern he's scrambled together, through the rags of his clothing, right inside him. Into his mind, tangling his thoughts. Into his heart, probing his wounds. It's been so long. How long has it been? How long has he been away?<br><br> An owl cries, eerie, hollow. In the undergrowth, something screams. Something dies. Stop, he whispers. Don't. But nobody's listening. His words fall into the quiet of the night forest and are lost. He's lost. The cold moon will kill him before he can find his way. The way back to . . . to . . .<br><br> A fragment comes to him; then it's gone. Another piece, and another. A story . . . but the meaning slips away before he can grasp it. Shivering body. Chattering teeth. A man . . . A man building . . . A man making a house, a strange house . . . He can feel the wood under his hands, his crooked hands . . . Long ago, so long ago . . . Was there a rhyme for the building, a charm, a spell? Crooked hands. Crooked yew. He makes the words with his lips, but there is no sound. Blackthorn, ivy and crooked yew.<br><br> He can't remember much. But what he remembers is enough, for now. Enough to keep his heart beating; enough to keep him breathing through the cold night, until morning. The beech tree will shelter him; she will spread her strong arms over him, shutting out the chill eye of the moon. And when the sun rises and the long night is over, he knows where he will go.<br><br> 2<br><br> Cara<br><br> T he forest knew everything. News passed on a breath of wind, in the call of an owl, in the small pattern of a squirrel's paw prints. The trout in the stream learned it. The lark soaring high above saw it. The knowledge was in the hearts of the trees and in the mysterious rustling of their leaves. It was a deep-down wisdom, as solemn as a druid's prayer.<br><br> She never talked about it. Not with Father, not with Aunt Della, not even with Gorm&#x2021;n. She'd learned long ago that if she spoke of that great knowledge, people thought she was being foolish or fanciful. That didn't matter. What mattered was saying it to the trees, over and over, so they knew she was their friend and guardian and could hear their slow voices. She spoke to each of them in turn, in a whisper, with her body against the trunk and her cheek pressed to the bark, as if she and the tree shared the same beating heart. Rough oak, smooth willow, furrowed ash, every tree in the wood. I will protect you. I will guard you. I give you my word.<br><br> The promise wasn't foolish or fanciful. It made perfect sense. One day the holding at Wolf Glen would be hers to watch over. Mother was dead. Father would never marry again. There was nobody else to inherit the house, the farm, the forest. All of it, and all the folk who lived and worked there, would be hers to care for, hers to look after.<br><br> Father didn't talk about the future, even now that Cara was in her sixteenth year. But she knew he expected her to marry someday and produce an heir. She let herself dream, sometimes, about what might have been if she had not been a girl and the only child. She could have become a master wood-carver. She could have spent all day making creatures and chests and chairs with fine decoration, toys for children, platters to hold fruit, spindles and cradles and walking staves with owls on them. Or she could have been a forester like Gorm&#x2021;n. Gorm&#x2021;n had been her friend since almost before she could walk. He had taught her the properties of different woods. Sometimes she would open up her special storage chest and get out the collection of little animals she'd made over the years. She loved them all, from the rabbit she had crafted from pine at six years old to the owl she'd coaxed not long ago from a well-weathered block of oak. The owl had its wings lifted, ready for flight, and when Cara looked at it she imagined spreading wings of her own and flying off over the treetops, wild and free. When she had held each of her little creatures in turn, stroked each, spoken softly to each, she would shut them away in the chest again.<br><br> Soon, she knew, Father would start looking for a prospective husband for her. Father and Aunt Della had set their expectations high, hoping for a chieftain's son. But wouldn't that mean she would have to leave Wolf Glen? That could not happen. She would be like a sapling pulled up roughly, roots and all, then shoved into barren ground where it could not thrive. She would turn into a dull shadow of a woman whom nobody could possibly want as a wife. And who would look after the forest if she was not here? Her father loved Wolf Glen as she did, but his love was tinged with a darkness she did not understand.<br><br> Some girls were already wed at fifteen. Some were mothers. But that was not possible for her. It was unthinkable. If she married, how would she have time for any of the things that mattered? There would be no time to hear the many voices of the forest, no time to watch the patterns of leaves and light, no time to breathe the crisp air, no time to feel the weight of a fine piece of wood in her hands, seeing in her mind the forms that lay within. What if the husband her father chose for her did not understand these things? What if she tried to talk to him and her words suddenly vanished, the way they did sometimes when she was talking to Father or Aunt Della? The suitor would think her a half-wit, and Father would be furious, and that would make it even more impossible to get words out.<br><br> Perhaps she could refuse to wed unless the man loved the same things she loved. Somewhere, surely, there must be at least one other person like her. If she could summon the right words, maybe she could persuade Father to wait awhile. Some women married and had babies when they were quite old, twenty or even five-and-twenty. Her maid Alba had told her so. There was plenty of time. Years.<br><br> Or so she thought, up till the day the wild man came to Wolf Glen, and everything changed.<br><br> She�d been out by the barn, showing Gorm&#x2021;n a drawing she�d made for a carving of a squirrel. He�d promised to look out for the right piece of wood but warned her it might take some time to find it. �Off you go, then,� he�d said in his gruff way. �I�ve my big ax to sharpen, and I don�t want you anywhere near while I�m doing it, young lady.�<br><br> Alba had come to the yard too, but now she was nowhere in sight. One of the farm cats had produced a litter of kittens not long ago, and Cara guessed her maid was in the barn petting them; Alba loved cats. It was a good opportunity to go walking on her own-not far enough to get either Gorm&#x2021;n or Alba in trouble, just down to the heartwood house. She could be back before anyone noticed she was gone. There was a rule about wandering off without a companion, and Aunt Della would be unhappy if she found out Cara had broken it. The rule was nonsense. Cara could find her way home from anywhere in the forest, even places where she had never been before. The trees were her friends. What harm could she possibly come to? Perhaps Aunt Della thought her stupid enough to get in the way of an ax like that giant implement Gorm&#x2021;n was working on now. That was just as silly. Gorm&#x2021;n had taught her to be careful in the workshop. She knew how tools should be used, how they were kept sharp, how they were protected from rust. She knew how to avoid cutting herself or someone else when she used her wood-carving knives. But she couldn't explain that to Aunt Della. In her aunt's opinion, a young lady should spend her time sewing, spinning, weaving, and learning how to run a household, not messing about with sharp objects and making things that were of no possible use to anyone. Most times, while Cara was still struggling to find the right words, Aunt Della would end the conversation by saying, "Oh, Cara, you're such a child." But that wasn't true. She had her moon-bleeding now, and her body was changing, and that meant, surely, that she was not a child but a woman.<br><br> The heartwood house was not much of a house, only an old ruin in a clearing. Each winter it crumbled away a bit more. Although it was not very far from the barn, the pattern of the trees and the rise and fall of the land meant it could barely be seen until a person was almost on top of it. Father had been building it at the time of her mother's death. Once Suanach was gone, work on the house had ceased. It had been left as it was, hardly even a shelter for forest creatures, since it had no roof. In another year or two the last of it would fall and the forest would reclaim the clearing. Cara liked the quiet way the wild things were moving to blanket the broken structure.<br><br> When she was little, but old enough to be curious, she'd been full of questions about the heartwood house. In those days she'd had no trouble saying what she wanted to, straight out. She'd been brimming with words. Why was it called that? What was it for? Why couldn't they finish building it? Back then, more of the structure had been standing, and it had been easier to imagine what it might have been like had the work been finished. She had noticed, even then, that there were different kinds of wood in it. She'd wandered through the ruin touching them, looking at the colors and the patterns of them, guessing what they were, until Father had caught her at it and ordered her away from the place, saying it was not safe. He did not answer any of her questions. Indeed, he was so stern and sad that she stopped asking him.<br><br> Aunt Della gave all the questions the same response: she had not been living at Wolf Glen while Cara's mother was alive, and when Suanach had died, the heartwood house had been abandoned. So Aunt Della knew nothing at all about it except, she said, that it was a subject best not discussed, and especially not in T&#x2014;la's hearing. Cara would be better off putting her excess curiosity into learning her letters and numbers or improving her plain sewing.<br><br> Gorm&#x2021;n knew the answers, some of them anyway, but even he was reluctant to talk. When she was a little older Cara realized her persistence could have got him into trouble. He could have lost his position in the household and been sent away from Wolf Glen, which had been his home for years. Gorm&#x2021;n was a kindly man, and patient with her. Why was it called a heartwood house? That was a name from an old tale. No, he did not know the tale, but a heartwood house was said to be lucky. When Cara had commented with five-year-old bluntness that it had not been very lucky for her mother, since she had died, Gorm&#x2021;n had crouched down, taken her hands in his and looked her straight in the eye.<br><br> "Cara," he'd said, his voice so soft and sorrowful it made her feel shivery, "don't ever say that to your father. Promise me."<br><br> "But why?"<br><br> "Because he thinks, if he'd got it finished, she might have . . . because it would make him very, very sad. Promise."<br><br> "I promise." She'd hardly understood, back then. "Why didn't he get it finished?"<br><br> "Never mind that."<br><br> "You could have built it," she'd said.<br><br> That had made Gorm&#x2021;n smile. "Finding the wood, getting all the pieces ready, maybe. Putting a house together, no. I'm no builder. And this would be quite a tricky sort of house. A very special house." Then, in a different tone, "Want to see a thrush's nest? I spotted one this morning, up in the big oak."<br><br> Her mother and the heartwood house and the things she could not ask her father had all been instantly forgotten. A thrush's nest! With eggs in it, or even little baby birds! She was, after all, only five years old.<br><br> But the promise she'd made was a deep-down thing, and Cara did remember it. As time passed and she grew up, the heartwood house crumbled away year by year, and Father did not mend it, and never once did she ask him why.<br><br> There was a special tree down by the heartwood house. Cara called it the guardian oak. When she was little, it had seemed to her so tall that its topmost branches surely touched the clouds. It had seemed a being of wonder and secrets, full of hiding places, tenanted by all manner of creatures, the seen and the unseen. She'd been a confident climber almost from the time she could walk, and had spent more time than her father and aunt ever imagined up in that tree, safe in the cradle of its great arms, pretending to be a squirrel or a bird or a beetle, peering out through the foliage to see folk about their work, hoping nobody would come looking for her before she was ready to be found. Birds would gather on the branches around her, preening their feathers, making their subtle sounds, taking so little notice of her that she might as well have been part of the tree. Sometimes they would come and perch on her shoulders or in her hair. She used to tell the guardian oak stories, the kind of stories little children make up, and she thought the tree replied in a voice so slow and deep that human ears could not really understand it, though she knew what it was saying: Ah, yes. Tell me more, small one. Even now she told the tree her secrets. It was so much easier to talk to trees than to people. People didn't stay quiet and listen, really listen. People interrupted. They fidgeted. You could see from their faces that their thoughts were at least half on something quite different. Aunt Della would be thinking, How will this strange child ever find a husband? Father would be lost in some dream of the past, his eyes full of a sorrow his only daughter could not lift. Gorm&#x2021;n was a good listener, but even he would have his mind on whatever job he had to start on as soon as Cara had finished her tale.</p><h2>Gutshot: Stories</h2><p>A woman creeps through the ductwork of a quiet home. A medical procedure reveals an object of worship. A carnivorous reptile divides and cauterizes a town. Amelia Gray's curio cabinet expands in <i>Gutshot</i>, where isolation and coupling are pushed to their dark and outrageous edges. A master of the macabre, Gray's work is not for the faint of heart or gut: lick at your own risk.</p><p>Amelia Gray grew up in Tucson, Arizona. She is the author of three books: <i>AM/PM</i>, <i>Museum of the Weird</i> (winner of the Ronald Sukenick/American Book Review Innovative Fiction Prize), and <i>THREATS</i> (a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction). She lives in Los Angeles, where she is at work on a novel.<p>&#x201c;Reading <i>Gutshot</i> is a little like being blindfolded and pelted from all sides with fire, Jell-O and the occasional live animal. You'll be messy at the end and slightly beaten up, but surprised and certainly entertained . . . She pushes against the outer limits of what humans can and will do. She seems to be testing her readers, too. Will you come with me here? How about if I take it a little further? Are you still game?&#x201d; &#x2015;Ramona Ausubel, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Amelia Gray sounds like no one else. Her writing is by turns horrifying, funny, sexy and grotesque, but woe be to those who want to pin it down as horror, comedy, romance or fantasy. Sentence by sentence, these stories are simple, rarely complicated by rhetorical flourishes or formal experimentation, but the scenes they build can be deeply complex - and the emotions they summon often contradictory, too. And, at the beating heart of it all, Gray's on a quest to reclaim the body's rightful place in literature - the clumsy, bloody, inconvenient body, which so often gets left behind in high-minded drama . . . By baring a bit of blood to the world, she reminds readers we're blood-bearing creatures after all, not just selves but bodies with beating hearts.&#x201d; &#x2015;Colin Dwyer, <i>NPR</i></p><p>&#x201c;Viscerally wicked.&#x201d; &#x2015;Natalie Beach, <i>O, The Oprah Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;The 38 stories in<i> Gutshot</i> may be short, but they're also downright haunting. Gray's characters are often dark, awkward, and funny--a serial vomiter, unlikely conjoined twins--and lurking through desolate landscapes, finding small, strange joys.&#x201d; &#x2015;Steph Opitz, <i>Marie Claire</i></p><p>&#x201c;The stories in <i>Gutshot</i>, also aptly named, get at you right in the viscera, full of bodily fluids and strange sights and smells. They often end not with a neat tying-up of the various elements, but as if something exploded, like dynamite breaking down a door . . . But <i>Gutshot</i> is not all swagger and shock-there's a softness hiding under the derangement, a visible tenderness for her troubled characters that have found themselves lost in the margins of existence, that becomes all the more affecting as it moves with and against the character's sharp edges.&#x201d; &#x2015;Juliet Escoria, <i>Vice</i></p><p>&#x201c;In Gray's (<i>Threats</i>, 2012) latest unique, punchy collection, she melds the inexplicable with everyday realities . . . Gray's bountiful five-part collection incorporates tales and vignettes both absorbing and unconventional . . . While eccentricities are on display, Gray's stories also deftly capture the startling moments when her characters pull off their armor and reveal their genuine selves.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Strange, fable-like, and physical, Gray's stories are driven by uncanny forces and set in organic yet unnatural worlds . . . Masterly gathering of forces [are] at the heart of the collection: black humor brushes up against abject tragedy, desperation and abuse, longing loneliness, and even hopeful peace. Gray dazzlingly renders the wide array of human experience in these potent, haunting stories.<br> &#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;The minute details of life are memorably rendered in surreal and sometimes grotesque ways . . . [Gray] takes familiar elements and pushes them toward an eerie, transgressive place . . . This is Gray's fourth book (and third story collection), and it features the widest stylistic range of any of her books to date. . . Grim, bittersweet . . . comic . . . and emotionally harrowing. The best of Gray's stories find that balance between devastation and humor and navigate an uneasy territory with agility. <br>&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Gutshot</i> is a wild journey through the singular imagination of Amelia Gray, one of the most ambitious and relentlessly inventive writers of our time.

Every story is visceral, fearless, and painfully true. &#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Catherine Lacey, author of Nobody Is Ever Missing</i></p><p>&#x201c;Exhilarating and violently creative, these stories are an assault on expectation. <i>Gutshot</i> is a rare, new original, and Amelia Gray is her own startling genre. This is a book to be experienced, to be taught and<br>obsessed over, to live as a prized weapon on your bookshelf.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alissa Nutting, author of Tampa</i></p><p>&#x201c;Amelia Gray's writing makes you feel like you've been shot out of a cannon. You're disoriented, stunned, completely overcome . . . but you're also flying through the air. Get ready. Gutshot is a book of lit matches.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lindsay Hunter, author of Ugly Girls</i></p><p>&#x201c;Call them what you must-stories, fables, parables, nanonovels of melancholized hilarity-but Amelia Gray's super-concentrated, hyper-velocitous prose marvelments do what so few fictions even attempt: leave you gasping from one unsettling sentence to the next. Have our clammiest moments and the squishes, the squirms, of our unthriving, unsightly bodies ever been rendered with such tender and generous genius? <i>Gutshot</i> has the delirious feel of a heart-shaker of a book that has been waiting forever to get itself written and, lucky for us, has finally fetched up stickingly on the page.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Gary Lutz, author of Stories in the Worst Way</i></p></p><h2>The Yage Letters Redux</h2><p><p>In January 1953, William S. Burroughs began an expedition into the jungles of South America to find <i>yage</i>, the fabled hallucinogen of the Amazon. From the notebooks he kept and the letters he wrote home to Allen Ginsberg, Burroughs composed a narrative of his adventures that later appeared as <i>The Yage Letters</i>. For this edition, Oliver Harris has gone back to the original manuscripts and untangled the history of the text, telling the fascinating story of its genesis and cultural importance. Also included in this edition are extensive materials, never before published, by both Burroughs and Ginsberg.</p><p><b>William S. Burroughs </b>is widely recognized as one of the most influential and innovative writers of the twentieth century. His books include <i>Junky</i>, <i>Naked Lunch</i>, and <i>The Wild Boys</i>.</p></p><p>William Burroughs (1915-1997) is widely reconized as one of the most innovative writers of the twentieth century. His books include: Junky, Naked Lunch, The Soft Machine, and Cities of the Red Night. Allen Ginsberg is also the author of Howl and Other Poems, which was originally published by City Lights Books in the fall of 1956. Oliver Harris is a professor in Literature and Film in the School of American Studies at Keele University, he is the editor of The Letters of William S. Burroughs (Penguin) and the 50th anniversary definitive edition of Junky (Penguin).This epistolary novel, first published in 1963, is actually a fascinating travel log written mostly by Burroughs of a trip he made to Peru and Colombia in 1953 to track down the legendary yage vine (also called <i>ayahuasca</i>), valued among the Indians for its telepathic and anesthetic powers. After a padding of manuscript history from scholar Oliver Harris (<i>The Letters of William S. Burroughs</i>), we find Burroughs writing to Ginsberg, recording his mostly harrowing, occasionally enlightening experiments with the drug, as well as his experiences picking up stray boys and eluding nosy officials. The second half of the book, dated seven years later, contains letters and poems from Ginsberg to Burroughs from the same region and, in turn, record Ginsberg's more intensely spiritual trips ("visit the moon, see the dead, see God"). When not violently poisoned by the drug, Burroughs attained wild, beautifully rendered hallucinations of the "Composite City," and his reflections on the corruption of government and the insidious spread of disease prove haunting and masterly. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But when Henry of Anjou, the young and dynamic future king of England, arrives at the French court, he and the seductive Eleanor experience a mutual passion powerful enough to ignite the world. Indeed, after the annulment of Eleanor&#x2019;s marriage to Louis and her remarriage to Henry, the union of this royal couple creates a vast empire that stretches from the Scottish border to the Pyrenees&#x2014;and marks the beginning of the celebrated Plantagenet dynasty. But Henry and Eleanor&#x2019;s marriage, charged with physical heat, begins a fiery downward spiral marred by power struggles and bitter betrayals. Amid the rivalries and infidelities, the couple&#x2019;s rebellious sons grow impatient for power, and the scene is set for a vicious and tragic conflict that will threaten to engulf them all.</p><p><strong>Interesting Facts About Eleanor of Aquitaine, from Alison Weir</strong> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122-1204) is arguably the most important and admired female figure in medieval European history.</li> <li><em>Captive Queen</em> tells the epic and dramatic tale of this strong and remarkable woman who held her own in a male-dominated world. </li> <li>Eleanor was queen first to Louis VII of France and then to Henry II of England.</li> <li>Her lands comprised half of what is now France, making her the greatest heiress in Europe. The transfer of that landed inheritance, first to France and then to England, set the pattern of European diplomacy and warfare for the next four centuries.</li> <li>Her marriage to Henry II of England, which is the focus of <em>Captive Queen</em>, was one of the most passionate and tempestuous in history. Both Eleanor and Henry were larger-than-life, charismatic characters.</li> <li>Eleanor was a true daughter of the south of France, raised in a society in which women were valued more highly than elsewhere, and morals were lax. She grew up imbued with the culture and poetry of the troubadours, and her beauty was famous.</li> <li>Eleanor&#x2019;s reputation was notorious, in her own lifetime and increasingly thereafter. She was a sensual woman with little regard for the moral precepts of her day, and she had adulterous affairs with several men, including her uncle and her future father-in-law. </li> <li>Many of the romantic or sinister legends that have attached themselves to Eleanor&#x2019;s name center upon her rival, Henry&#x2019;s mistress, Rosamund de Clifford.

We didn&#x2019;t talk about it much after that. I went to school every day like any kid my age. No one in my family had ever been to college, so they insisted I keep going to school. I majored in physics.<br><br>I know what you&#x2019;re going to say. I wish I could tell you I went into science because of the hand, but I was always good at it. My parents figured out I had a knack for it early on. I must have been four years old when I got my first science kit for Christmas. One of those electronics kits. You could make a telegraph, or things like that, by squeezing wires into little metal springs. I don&#x2019;t think I would have done anything different had I listened to my father and stayed home that day.<br><br>Anyway, I graduated from college and I kept doing the only thing I knew how to do. I went to school. You should have seen my dad when we learned I was accepted at the University of Chicago. I&#x2019;ve never seen anyone so proud in my life. He wouldn&#x2019;t have been any happier had he won a million dollars. They hired me at the U of C after I finished my Ph.D.<br><br>&#x2014;When did you find the hand again?<br><br>&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t. I wasn&#x2019;t looking for it. It took seventeen years, but I guess you could say it found me.<br><br>&#x2014;What happened?<br><br>&#x2014;To the hand? The military took over the site when it was discovered.<br><br>&#x2014;When was that?<br><br>&#x2014;When I fell in. It took about eight hours before the military stepped in. Colonel Hudson&#x2014;I think that was his name&#x2014;was put in charge of the project. He was from the area so he knew pretty much everyone. I don&#x2019;t remember ever meeting him, but those who did had only good things to say about the man.<br><br>I read what little was left of his notes&#x2014;most of it was redacted by the military. In the three years he spent in charge, his main focus had always been figuring out what those carvings meant. The hand itself, which is mostly referred to as &#x201c;the artifact,&#x201d; is mentioned in passing only a few times, evidence that whoever built that room must have had a complex enough religious system. I think he had a fairly precise notion of what he wanted this to be.<br><br>&#x2014;What do you think that was?<br><br>&#x2014;I have no idea. Hudson was career military. He wasn&#x2019;t a physicist. He wasn&#x2019;t an archaeologist. He had never studied anything resembling anthropology, linguistics, anything that would be remotely useful in this situation. Whatever preconceived notion he had, it must have come from popular culture, watching Indiana Jones or something. Fortunately for him, he had competent people surrounding him. Still, it must have been awkward, being in charge and having no idea what&#x2019;s going on most of the time.<br><br>What&#x2019;s fascinating is how much effort they put into disproving their own findings. Their first analysis indicated the room was built about three thousand years ago. That made little sense to them, so they tried carbon-dating organic material found on the hand. The tests showed it to be much older, somewhere between five thousand and six thousand years old.<br><br>&#x2014;That was unexpected?<br><br>&#x2014;You could say that. You have to understand that this flies in the face of everything we know about American civilizations. The oldest civilization we&#x2019;re aware of was located in the Norte Chico region of Peru, and the hand appeared to be about a thousand years older. Even if it weren&#x2019;t, it&#x2019;s fairly obvious that no one carried a giant hand from South America all the way to South Dakota, and there were no civilizations as advanced in North America until much, much later.<br><br>In the end, Hudson&#x2019;s team blamed the carbon dating on contamination from surrounding material. After a few years of sporadic research, the site was determined to be twelve hundred years old and classified as a worship temple for some offshoot of Mississippian civilization.<br><br>I went through the files a dozen times. There is absolutely nothing, no evidence whatsoever to support that theory, other than the fact that it makes more sense than anything the data would suggest. If I had to guess, I would say that Hudson saw no military interest whatsoever in all this. He probably resented seeing his career slowly wither in an underground research lab and was eager to come up with anything, however preposterous, just to get out of there.<br><br>&#x2014;Did he?<br><br>&#x2014;Get out? Yes. It took a little more than three years, but he finally got his wish. He had a stroke while walking his dog and slipped into a coma. He died a few weeks later.<br><br>&#x2014;What happened to the project after he died?<br><br>&#x2014;Nothing. Nothing happened. The hand and panels collected dust in a warehouse for fourteen years until the project was demilitarized. Then the University of Chicago took over the research with NSA funding and somehow I was put in charge of studying the hand I fell in when I was a child. I don&#x2019;t really believe in fate, but somehow &#x201c;small world&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t begin to do this justice.<br><br>&#x2014;Why would the NSA get involved in an archaeological project?<br><br>&#x2014;I asked myself the same question. They fund all kinds of research, but this seems to fall outside their usual fields of interest. Maybe they were interested in the language for cryptology; maybe they had an interest in the material the hand is made of. In any case, they gave us a pretty big budget so I didn&#x2019;t ask too many questions. I was given a small team to handle the hard science before we handed everything over to the anthropology department. The project was still classified as top secret and, just like my predecessor, I was moved into an underground lab. I believe you&#x2019;ve read my report, so you know the rest.<br><br>&#x2014;Yes, I have read it. You sent your report after only four months. Some might think it was a little hasty.<br><br>&#x2014;It was a preliminary report, but yes. I don&#x2019;t think it was premature. OK, maybe a little, but I had made significant discoveries and I didn&#x2019;t think I could go much further with the data that I had, so why wait? There is enough in that underground room to keep us guessing for several lifetimes. I just don&#x2019;t think we have the knowledge to get much more out of this without getting more data.<br><br>&#x2014;Who is we?<br><br>&#x2014;Us. Me. You. Mankind. Whatever. There are things in that lab that are just beyond our reach right now.<br><br>&#x2014;Ok, so tell me about what you do understand. Tell me about the panels.<br><br>&#x2014;It&#x2019;s all in my report. There are sixteen of them, approximately ten feet by thirty-two feet each, less than an inch thick. All sixteen panels were made around the same period, approximately three thousand years ago. We . . . <br><br>&#x2014;If I may. I take it you do not subscribe to the cross-contamination theory?<br><br>&#x2014;As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, there&#x2019;s no real reason not to trust the carbon dating. And to be honest, how old these things are is the least of our problems. Did I mention the symbols have been glowing for the last seventeen years, with no apparent power source?<br><br>Each wall is made of four panels and has a dozen rows of eighteen to twenty symbols carved into it. Rows are divided into sequences of six or seven symbols. We counted fifteen distinct symbols in total. Most are used several times, some appear only once. Seven of them are curvy, with a dot in the center, seven are made of straight lines, and one is just a dot. They are simple in design but very elegant.<br><br>&#x2014;Had the previous team been able to interpret any of the markings?<br><br>&#x2014;Actually, one of the few sections of Hudson&#x2019;s report left intact by the military was the linguistic analysis. They had compared the symbols to every known writing system, past or present, but found no interesting correlation. They assumed each sequence of symbols represented a proposition, like an English sentence, but with no frame of reference, they couldn&#x2019;t even speculate as to their interpretation. Their work was thorough enough and documented at every step. I saw no reason to do the same thing twice and I declined the offer to add a linguist to the team. With nothing to compare this to, there was logically no way to arrive at any sort of meaning.<br><br>Perhaps I was biased&#x2014;because I stumbled onto it&#x2014;but I felt drawn to the hand. I couldn&#x2019;t explain it, but every fiber of my being was telling me the hand was the important piece.<br><br>&#x2014;Quite a contrast from your predecessor. So what can you tell me about it?<br><br>&#x2014;Well, it&#x2019;s absolutely stunning, but I assume you&#x2019;re not that interested in aesthetics. It measures 22.6 feet in length from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger. It seems to be solid, made of the same metallic material as the wall panels, but it&#x2019;s at least two thousand years older. It is dark gray, with some bronze overtones, and it has subtle iridescent properties.<br><br>The hand is open, fingers close together, slightly bent, as if holding something very precious, or a handful of sand, trying not to spill it. There are grooves where human skin would normally fold, others that seem purely decorative. All are glowing the same bright turquoise, which brings out the iridescence in the metal. The hand looks strong, but . . . sophisticated is the only word that comes to mind. I think it&#x2019;s a woman&#x2019;s hand.<br><br>&#x2014;I am more interested in facts at this point. What is this strong but sophisticated hand made of?<br><br>&#x2014;It proved nearly impossible to cut or otherwise alter by conventional means. It took several attempts to remove even a small sample from one of the wall panels. Mass spectrography showed it to be an alloy of several heavy metals, mostly iridium, with about 10 percent iron and smaller concentrations of osmium, ruthenium, and other metals of the platinum group.<br><br>&#x2014;It must be worth its weight in gold?<br><br>&#x2014;It&#x2019;s funny you should mention that. It doesn&#x2019;t weigh as much as it should so I&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s worth a lot more than its weight, in anything.<br><br>&#x2014;How much does it weigh?<br><br>&#x2014;Thirty-two metric tons . . . I know, it&#x2019;s a respectable weight, but it&#x2019;s inexplicably light given its composition. Iridium is one of the densest elements, arguably the densest, and even with some iron content, the hand should easily weigh ten times as much.<br><br>&#x2014;How did you account for that?<br><br>&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t. I still can&#x2019;t. I couldn&#x2019;t even speculate as to what type of process could be used to achieve this. In truth, the weight didn&#x2019;t bother me nearly as much as the sheer amount of iridium I was looking at. Iridium is not only one of the densest things you can find, it&#x2019;s also one of the rarest.<br><br>You see, metals of this group&#x2014;platinum is one of them&#x2014;love to bond with iron. That&#x2019;s what most of the iridium on Earth did millions of years ago when the surface was still molten and, because it&#x2019;s so heavy, it sunk to the core, thousands of miles deep. What little is left in the Earth&#x2019;s crust is usually mixed with other metals and it takes a complex chemical process to separate them.<br><br>&#x2014;How rare is it in comparison to other metals?<br><br>&#x2014;It&#x2019;s rare, very rare. Let&#x2019;s put it this way, if you were to put together all the pure iridium produced on the entire planet in a year, you&#x2019;d probably end up with no more than a couple metric tons. That&#x2019;s about a large suitcaseful. It would take decades, using today&#x2019;s technology, to scrounge up enough to build all this. It&#x2019;s just too scarce on Earth and there simply aren&#x2019;t enough chondrites lying around.<br><br>&#x2014;You lost me.<br><br>&#x2014;Sorry. Meteorites; stony ones. Iridium is so rare in Earth rocks that it is often undetectable. Most of the iridium we mine is extracted from fallen meteorites that didn&#x2019;t completely burn up in the atmosphere. To build this room&#x2014;and it seems safe to assume that this is not the only thing they would have built&#x2014;you&#x2019;d need to find it where there are a lot more than on the Earth&#x2019;s surface.<br><br>&#x2014;Journey to the center of the Earth?<br><br>&#x2014;Jules Verne is one way to go. To get this type of metal in massive quantities, you&#x2019;d either have to extract it thousands of miles deep or be able to mine in space. With all due respect to Mr. Verne, we haven&#x2019;t come close to mining deep enough. The deepest mines we have would look like potholes next to what you&#x2019;d need. Space seems much more feasible. There are private companies right now hoping to harvest water and precious minerals in space in the very near future, but all these projects are still in the early planning stages. Nonetheless, if you could harvest meteorites in space, you could get a lot more iridium, a whole lot more.<br><br>&#x2014;What else can you tell me?<br><br>&#x2014;That pretty much sums it up. After a few months of looking at this with every piece of equipment known to man, I felt we were getting nowhere. I knew we were asking the wrong questions, but I didn&#x2019;t know the right ones. I submitted a preliminary report and asked for a leave of absence.<br><br>&#x2014;Refresh my memory. What was the conclusion of that report?<br><br>&#x2014;We didn&#x2019;t build this.<br><br>&#x2014;Interesting. What was their reaction?<br><br>&#x2014;Request granted.<br><br>&#x2014;That was it?<br><br>&#x2014;Yes. I think they were hoping I wouldn&#x2019;t come back. I never used the word &#x201c;alien,&#x201d; but that&#x2019;s probably all they took out of my report.<br><br>&#x2014;That is not what you meant?<br><br>&#x2014;Not exactly. There might be a much more down-to-earth explanation, one I just didn&#x2019;t think of. As a scientist, all I can say is that humans of today do not have the resources, the knowledge, or the technology to build something like this. It&#x2019;s entirely possible that some ancient civilization&#x2019;s understanding of metallurgy was better than ours, but there wouldn&#x2019;t have been any more iridium around, whether it was five thousand, ten thousand, or twenty thousand years ago. So, to answer your question, no, I don&#x2019;t believe humans built these things. You can draw whatever conclusion you want from that.<br><br>I&#x2019;m not stupid; I knew I was probably putting an end to my career. I certainly annihilated any credibility I had with the NSA, but what was I going to do? Lie?<br><br>&#x2014;What did you do after you submitted your report?<br><br>&#x2014;I went home, to where it all began. I hadn&#x2019;t gone home in nearly four years, not since my father died.<br><br>&#x2014;Where is home?</p><h2>The City: A Vision in Woodcuts (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)</h2><p><p>"An absolute song for an ongoing visit with timelessness." &#x2014; <i>The New York Times<br></i>This graphic novel by an Expressionist master offers a stunning depiction of urban Europe between the world wars. First published in Germany in 1925, it presents unforgettable images from the tense and dynamic Weimar period, rendered in 100 woodcuts of remarkable force and beauty.<br>A pacifist during World War I, Belgian-born Frans Masereel (1889-1972) sympathized with the struggles of the working classes and strived to make his art accessible to ordinary people. His evocative woodcuts convey scenes of work and leisure, wealth and deprivation, and joy and loneliness. Banned by the Nazis, Masereel's works were championed in Communist countries; however, the artist steered clear of political affiliations. His clarity of vision transcends any propagandist use of the images, which stand as timeless indictments of oppression and injustice.<br>Thomas Mann described Masereel's works as "so strangely compelling, so deeply felt, so rich in ideas that one never tires of looking at them." Epic and unflinching in its scope, <i>The City</i> continues to influence modern fine and graphic art, while recapturing the mood of a vanished era.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Painting Wargaming Figures</h2><p>Javier Gomez, a highly talented figure painter of long experience and excellent reputation, shares the secrets of his success in this accessible &#39;how-to&#39; guide to painting miniatures. He takes the reader step-by-step through the whole process, from choice of materials (unlike other available guides it is not linked to any specific figure manufacturer) and preparation of the miniatures to basing and even advice on photographing the finished item. Techniques such as dry-brushing, ink-washing, shading and highlighting are all explained clearly with the help of step-by-step photographs and color charts. Specific case studies tackle a variety of useful subjects across all periods, such as mixing realistic flesh tones for different races; painting horses; guns and limbers; Medieval heraldry; Napoleonic uniforms; WW2 and modern camouflage patterns. Javier also clearly explains how these techniques and processes can be applied to all the major wargaming scales, from 40mm down to 6mm. Whatever historical period (or Sci-fi/Fantasy) and whatever scale the reader is interested in, this book is an invaluable source of practical advice and inspiration.</p><p>Javier Gomez, better known in wargaming circles as El Mercenario, is an award-winning figure painter with a very good reputation, to the extent that his painting services are used by the legendary figure sculptures the Perry twins. He is also editor of the Spanish-language military history magazine Desperto Ferro."... recommend this book to anyone who has maybe tried to paint wargaming figures in the past or is contemplating creating an army in order to play these types of games. I have used some of the suggestions here as well as the highlights for some of my own figures and they have produced improved results. The book is aimed primarily at the miniature wargaming community but is valuable for any modelers to incorporate these techniques into their painting projects.

Contrary to popular claims, there were no good old days of whiskey: before the twentieth century, consumers could never be sure just what was being poured in their cup&#x2014;unscrupulous profiteers could distill anything into booze and pawn it off as whiskey. Eventually, government and industry established legal definitions of what whiskey is and how it could be made, allowing for the distinctive styles of whiskey known today.</p><p><i>Whiskey</i> explains what whiskey is, how it is made, and how the types of whiskey differ.

Eight Apuleian vases of the fourth century B.C. are discovered in the swimming pool of a German-based art smuggler. More valuable than the recovery of the vases, however, is the discovery of the smuggler's card index detailing his deals and dealers. It reveals the existence of a web of <i>tombaroli</i>&#x2014;tomb raiders&#x2014; who steal classical artifacts, and a network of dealers and smugglers who spirit them out of Italy and into the hands of wealthy collectors and museums. Peter Watson, a former investigative journalist for the <i>London Sunday Times</i> and author of two previous expos�s of art world scandals, names the key figures in this network that has depleted Europe's classical artifacts. Among the loot are the irreplaceable and highly collectable vases of Euphronius, the equivalent in their field of the sculpture of Bernini or the painting of Michelangelo. The narrative leads to the doors of some major institutions: Sothebys, the Getty Museum in L.A., the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York among them. Filled with great characters and human drama, <i>The Medici Conspiracy</i> authoritatively exposes another shameful round in one of the oldest games in the world: theft, smuggling and duplicitous dealing, all in the name of art.</p><p><b>Peter Watson</b> writes for the <i>New York Times</i> and has written weekly columns on the art market for the <i>London Sunday Times</i>, <i>Observer</i> and <i>Evening Standard</i>.

Written like a detective story... the book is a thoroughly researched, pacey and accessible read.&#34; The Guardian &#34;The Medici Conspiracy documents convincingly - indeed takes the lid off - the extraordinary way that some of the world&#39;s most famous museums, aided by some of the most prominent collectors, have paid corrupt dealers millions of dollars to obtain notable antiquities looted from ancient sites in Italy and beyond and then illegally exported... At times the tale is as complex as The Da Vinci Code, but this time the cast is composed of real characters. This is not fiction.... Watson and Todeschini have written a fascinating account of conspiracy and corruption in high places. It will rock the world of the complacent collectors who ask no questions. It shows how several museums have undermined their own reputations.

These unforgettable dispatches from World Series, Super Bowls, and title bouts for the ages were written on deadline with passion, spontaneity, humor, and a gift for the memorable phrase. Read avidly day in and day out by a sports-mad public, these columnists became journalistic celebrities in their home cities, their coverage trusted and savored, their opinions hotly debated. Some even helped change the games they wrote about. Gathered here in a groundbreaking anthology, their writings capture some of sport's most enduring moments and many of its all-time greats: Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, and Michael Jordan among them. But the best American sportswriters also found ways to write powerfully about lesser-known athletes and to convey, often with heartbreaking honesty and insight, the less glamorous and more tragic facets of the games we love. In its survey of the finest American sportswriting from Ring Lardner to Thomas Boswell, from Red Smith and Jimmy Cannon to Bob Ryan and Michael Wilbon, <i>The Great American Sports Page</i> takes the measure of the human richness, complexity, and competitive spirit of sports and the athletes who continue to fascinate and inspire us.</p><p><b>John Schulian</b> was a sports columnist for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> and <i>Philadelphia Daily News</i> before moving to Hollywood, where he was, among other things, the co-creator of <i>Xena: Warrior Princess</i>.

He is the author of <i>Sports Guy</i> (200) and <i>Moving the Chains: Tom Brady and the Pursuit of Everything</i> (2006)."To read the book is to be astonished, again and again, by the ingenuity and flair of the writers who thrived in this medium.

The surprise and delight of&nbsp;<i>The Great American Sports Page</i>, John Schulian&#x2019;s selections from a century&#x2019;s worth of newspaper columns about baseball, boxing, football, gymnastics, and (in one case) swimming the English Channel, is how&nbsp;<i>often</i>&nbsp;it happens&#x2014;how often the writers connect, how often the prose approaches the condition of flat-out poetry."&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;James Parker,&nbsp;<i>The Atlantic<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;The entries from the first 50 or 60 years exhibit the boisterous hyperbole, epic mood, circumlocution, simile and metaphor that once made sports writing a sport in itself. . . .

Absolutely magnificent." <br> -Jeff VanderMeer for <i>Omnivoracious</i><br><br> "Equal parts J.K. Rowling, Douglas Adams, and Shel Silverstein." <br> -<i>Washington Post</i><br><br> "This is a children's book for adults who want to remember the joy of youth, but want more complexity." <br> -<i>Philadelphia Weekly</i><br><br> "Cheerfully insane. Remains lively and inventive right through the final heroic battle between good and evil." <br> -<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "Moers's great strength, as evidenced by the multitude of characters he presents, is his creativity. Less a text and more an imagination on paper." <br> -<i>Philadelphia Enquirer</i><br><br> "A yarn of drollery, deeper meaning and sheer lunacy." <br> -<i>Rolling Stone</i></p><h2>Supernatural Strategies for Making a Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Group</h2><p><p>"Proscriptive how-to advice ranges over a wide number of subjects (e.g., sex, band photos, etc.) and can be seen both as skewering the cultural idolatry associated with rock and as genuine counsel. Verdict: Svenonius's sociopolitical analysis of rock and roll is intellectually interesting, as when he posits that the genre was 'brought about by the industrial revolution, the harnessing of electricity, and the miscegenation of various poor, exploited, and indentured cultures in the USA.'"<br>--<i><b>Library Journal</b></i></p><p>"So much of the allure here is in watching Svenonius skirt absurdity. He's always seemed delighted by the fact that the profound and the preposterous can sound awfully alike, a realization that puts him in line with an avant-garde tradition that stretches back before rock 'n' roll crystallized this fact...Svenonius has the spirit of a long-gone punk past, but his book has more to tell us about rock's here-and-now than about its hereafter. Neither bourgeois nor prestigious, <i>Supernatural Strategies</i> may be the rare book by a rock musician to retain any power or threat."<br>--<b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b></p><p>"Like its author, <i>Supernatural Strategies</i> is part tongue-in-cheek, part deadly serious--a satire of rock's consumerist origins but also a thoughtful treatise on what it means to devote yourself to a collective...Drawing from the wisdom of rock 'n' roll's most famous ghosts, Svenonius' advice ranges from hilarious to cryptic to surprisingly useful."<br>--<b><i>Pitchfork</i></b></p><p>"Svenonius has walked the walk...Even today--as the frontman of Chain &amp; The Gang and the host of the online talk show Soft Focus--he remains cool, cryptic, and impeccably dressed, a mod magician with a trick always lurking up his tailored sleeve."<br>--<i><b>The Onion AV Club</b></i></p><p>"If 'write what you know' is one of authorship's prime dictates, then Ian F. Svenonius seems uniquely qualified...Svenonius' contrarian, anti-establishment rhetoric is his greatest gift...<i>Strategies</i> plays to these same strengths by allowing him to run roughshod riot over hallowed ground he's already trod--and sometimes paved--more than a few times."<br>--<b><i>Baltimore City Paper</i></b></p><p>Ian F. Svenonius's experience as an iconic underground rock musician--playing in such highly influential and revolutionary outfits as The Make-Up and The Nation of Ulysses--gives him special insight on techniques for not only starting but also surviving a rock 'n' roll group. Therefore, he's written an instructional guide, which doubles as a warning device, a philosophical text, an exercise in terror, an aerobics manual, and a coloring book.</p><p>This volume features essays (and black-and-white illustrations) on everything the would-be star should know to get started, such as Sex, Drugs, Sound, Group Photo, The Van, and Manufacturing Nostalgia. <i>Supernatural Strategies</i> will serve as an indispensable guide for a new generation just aching to boogie.</p></p><p>Ian F. Svenonius: Ian F. Svenonius is the author of the underground best seller The Psychic Soviet (Drag City Press 2007). He was also the host of VBS.tv's Soft Focus, a different breed of chat show, where he spoke to people such as Mark E Smith, Genesis P Orridge, Chan Marshall, and Ian Mackaye. As a musician he has created 18 albums and countless singles in various rock 'n' roll combos (Chain &amp; the Gang, Weird War, Make Up, Nation of Ulysses, et al).<br><p>"Because living musicians fear competition too much to share secrets of success, this manual, we're told, was transcribed during a s�ance where dead rock stars lectured on profound rock &amp; roll truths. Mary Wells, spelling in spaghetti, and Buddy Holly, scrawling in salt, warned of cruel, social-engineering overlords that both control and fear rock revolutionaries. But the greatest prank the book pulls is camouflaging, beneath astrological and geopolitical inanity, the author's passionately conveyed truths about integrity, artistry, repression, perseverance and the cruelties and joys of the music industry. It seems that even when utilizing a stone-faced, pummeling, punch line&#x2013;free tone, truths are still best told in jest. And it also seems rock &amp; roll will never die, or if it does, it will still be accessible through spiritualism."<br>--<i><b>Time Out Chicago</b></i></p><p>"Obviously Svenonius's discussion of rock music is far from supernatural. If anything, it debunks the notion that musicians are untouchable, mystical beings by showing just how much planning, how much strategy goes into making a successful group. And while there is a cynicism that pervades this book, Svenonius is nevertheless coming to the topic as a rock 'n' roll fan, a practitioner, and someone who believes truly in the art form."--<br><b>Bomblog</b></p><p>"The phenomenon is explained in <i>Supernatural Strategies for Making a Rock 'n' Roll Group</i>, a new book by Washington musician, author and general punk provocateur Ian Svenonius. His how-to guide for forming a band is plenty tongue-in-cheek--the advice is presented through the words of dead rock stars contacted via seance--but he hits on some significant truths."<br>--<b><i>Washington Post</i></b></p><p>"Ian F. Svenonius' new book, <i>Supernatural Strategies for Making a Rock 'n' Roll Group</i>, is laugh-out-loud funny. Svenonius mixes the Vietnam War, Industrial Revolution and other seemingly disconnected events via fictional interviews with several (real) dead rock stars who share their thoughts on topics, such as the all-important band van, communication, the evolution from gang to group, sex, 'the narcotic effect of pop music' and discipline. Whether you intend to form a rock group, are interested in history or popular culture, or just want to read essays that are genuinely smart, this is the book."<br>--<i><b>Sacramento News &amp; Review</b></i></p><p>"Ian's theories are hilarious, insightful, intelligent and well-written, both satisfying for rock history enthusiasts and enlightening for newbies...Showboating your reading material is unconditionally off-putting, but it's hard not to feel cool holding a book called '<i>Supernatural Strategies for Making a Rock 'N' Roll Group</i>' sitting in a seat on the bus or an exercise bike at the gym. Its pocket size makes it ideal for reading during long rides in the tour van or sitting on a crate backstage in between loading equipment. And of course like Mao's <i>Little Red Book</i>, the size makes it easy to keep on hand for quotations, instruction or spiritual guidance."<br>--<b><i>The Thousands</i></b></p><p>"Written in a language couched in satire and anchored by years of experience, it is both a rigorous study of an elusive and enduring cultural art and a sobering critique of its many tortured machinations."<br>--<b><i>Portland Phoenix</i></b> (Maine)</p><p>"<i>Supernatural Strategies</i>...takes a spiritual approach to guiding rock star wannabes to success. The book's imagined conversations are very funny (it's clear that Svenonius didn't actually talk with Paul McCartney and probably never sought out a medium). But beyond being humorous, <i>Supernatural Strategies</i> is also very informative and well researched. While Svenonius shares his endless wealth of musical knowledge, this book also serves as a critique of capitalism, consumerism and American imperialism."<br>--<b>Brooklyn Based</b></p><p>"As its title indicates, prolific DC underground rocker Ian Svenonius's arch new book, <i>Supernatural Strategies for Making a Rock 'n' Roll Group</i>, is 'an indispensable guide for anyone attempting to create a rock 'n' roll group.'

There are long tangents about gang culture, music and capitalism, and chapters based around s�ances calling on dead music stars as wide-ranging as Brian Jones, Big Mama Thornton and Mary Wells."<br>--<i><b>Style Weekly</b></i> (Richmond)</p><p>"Svenonius, a member of the band Chain and the Gang, presents a comical but nonetheless serious guide to starting a rock-band with the aid of the supernatural. The pocket-sized guide reads as a systematic analysis of the choices rock-bands have made in the past, as well as a detail of the practical features of the profession itself, distilled for their insights, into success."<br>--<b><i>Book News Inc.</i></b></p><p>"According to <i>Supernatural Strategies for Making a Rock 'n' Roll Group</i>, a 250-page treatise by Ian F. Svenonius that arrived at my office the other day, the secrets to a successful rock band are buried in the dead heads of the deceased, former rock 'n' roll greats who are 'no longer contaminated by the stultifying climate of competitive capitalism,' the author writes."<br>--<b><i>Oakland Tribune</i></b></p><p>"Current and former band members interested in an underground scene stalwart breaking down the inner workings of a group's success (and inevitable failure)--and then taking those inner workings even further, into satire--will enjoy this book. Those who just have a thing for the political rhetoric and undeniable panache of Ian Svenonius--well, even better."<br>--<b><i>Chicago Reader</i></b></p><p>"Enterprising young groups might do well to pay attention to Svenonius' book. Steal enough from it and you might find your group reuniting at Coachella in a decade or so."<br>--<b><i>Creative Loafing Atlanta</i></b></p><p>"Svenonius's latest screed is a 'bizarrely erudite' meditation on the hazards and resulting socioeconomic upheaval that occurs with the formation of rock groups (which are really just a natural progression from male street gangs of post-War Western society, he says.) Naturally, it's smart and meticulously crafted...Part cautionary how-to guide and part philosophical meditation on the current state of rock, <i>Strategies</i> exhumes rock's past to consider its present and help guide its future toward, hopefully, a more astrologically synchronous state."<br>--<b><i>Gapers Block</i></b></p><p>"Svenonius...continues to prove himself an unconventional and important thinker when it comes to cultural studies and pop music."<br>--<b><i>Pittsburgh City Paper</i></b></p><p>"<i>Supernatural Strategies for Making a Rock 'n' Roll Group</i> is not an easy book. It's not technically difficult to read--far from it. What it does do is make you step back and think (maybe for the first time) about what rock-n-roll really is...and is not."<br>--<b><i>Chattanooga Pulse</i></b> (Tennessee)</p><p>"Poseur, provocateur and pontificator, Svenonius' most recent cultural product comes in the form of a book. Both as satire and as plain truth, <i>Supernatural Strategies for Making a Rock 'n' Roll Group</i> is a scream--something that could only be produced by the punk rock aesthete who was once named <i>Sassy</i> magazine's 'Sassiest Boy in America.'"<br>--<b><i>Stomp &amp; Stammer Magazine</i></b> (Atlanta, GA)</p><p>"Regardless of whether you think you're in the choir he's preaching to, or if you just want some pointers on starting a band but can't be bothered to summon the spirit of Buddy Holly for religious reasons, read this guide for the perplexed and you will not be disappointed."<br>--<b><i>Fanzine</i></b> (Atlanta, GA)</p><p>"What a delightfully odd little book this is.

Wallace (Norton Paperback)</h2><p><p><strong>The great politician, agriculturalist, economist, author, and businessman&#x2015;loved and reviled, and finally now revealed.</strong></p> The great politician, agriculturalist, economist, author, and businessman&#x2015;loved and reviled, and finally now revealed. The first full biography of Henry A. Wallace, a visionary intellectual and one of this century's most important and controversial figures. Henry Agard Wallace was a geneticist of international renown, a prolific author, a groundbreaking economist, and a businessman whose company paved the way for a worldwide agricultural revolution. He also held two cabinet posts, served four tumultuous years as America's wartime vice president under FDR, and waged a quixotic campaign for president in 1948. Wallace was a figure of Sphinx-like paradox: a shy man, uncomfortable in the world of politics, who only narrowly missed becoming president of the United States; the scion of prominent Midwestern Republicans and the philosophical voice of New Deal liberalism; loved by millions as the Prophet of the Common Man, and reviled by millions more as a dangerous, misguided radical. John C. Culver and John Hyde have combed through thousands of document pages and family papers, from Wallace's letters and diaries to previously unavailable files sealed within the archives of the Soviet Union. Here is the remarkable story of an authentic American dreamer. A <em>Washington Post</em> Best Book of the Year. 32 pages of b/w photographs.

The stories come from all perspectives--innocent and guilty, comical and terrifying--but their common thread is the dehumanizing nature of prison existence. Sometimes poignant, sometimes violent, sometimes even funny, these stories are consistently disturbing and sobering glimpses into the incarcerated life. <i>Prison Writing in 20th-Century America</i> speaks for a largely silent but growing population. As the percentage of Americans who are incarcerated continues to climb, the stories in this book--and their testimonial to the depths to which both the jailed and the jailers can sink--become all the more urgent. <i>--Lisa Higgins</i>Tom Wicker covered American politics at <b>The New York Times</b> from 1960 to the early 1990s, when he succeeded Arthur Krock as writer of the &#x201c;In the Nation&#x201d; column.

It&#x2019;s neither the biological essence of manliness nor even &#x201c;the male sex hormone.&#x201d; This unauthorized biography pries T, as it&#x2019;s known, loose from over a century of misconceptions that undermine science even as they make urban legends about this hormone seem scientific.</p><p>T&#x2019;s story didn&#x2019;t spring from nature: it is a tale that began long before the hormone was even isolated, when nineteenth-century scientists went looking for the chemical essence of masculinity. And so this molecule&#x2019;s outmoded, authorized life story persisted, providing a handy rationale for countless behaviors&#x2015;from the boorish and the belligerent to the exemplary and enviable. What we think we know about T has stood in the way of an accurate understanding of its surprising and diverse functions and effects. Rebecca Jordan-Young and Katrina Karkazis focus on what T does in six domains: reproduction, aggression, risk-taking, power, sports, and parenting. At once arresting and deeply informed, <i>Testosterone</i> allows us to see the real T for the first time.</p></p><p><p>Rebecca M.

The authors present strong and persuasive arguments that demythologize and defetishize T as a molecule containing quasi-magical properties, or as exclusively related to masculinity and males.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Linda Roland Danil</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A deeply researched and thoughtful book that adds a fresh perspective to a growing body of work aiming to debunk myths about hormones.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Nature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In [the authors&#x2019;] hands, testosterone provides fruitful ground for understanding what it means to be human, not as isolated physical bodies but as dynamic social beings.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Erika Lorraine Milam</b><b>, </b><b><i>Science</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Eye-opening...Readers interested in the messiness of the relationship between hormones and behavior, and willing to consider that science can be far from neutral and objective, will find high-density food for thought in [this] stimulating work.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s stimulating fun when the assumptions and interpretations of scientific findings must undergo major revision. It&#x2019;s more than just fun when that revisionism concerns a subject rife with sociopolitical implications with a history of doing harm. Jordan-Young and Karkazis ably take on this task with respect to the perpetual misinterpretation of what testosterone has to do with behavior, a subject at the intersection of masculinity, gender, aggression, hierarchy, race, and class. This subtle, important book forces rethinking not just about one particular hormone, but about the way the scientific process is embedded in social context.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert M. Sapolsky, author of <i>Behave</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With <i>Testosterone: An Unauthorized Biography</i>, we can add testosterone folklore to the mythology claiming that biology determines our character, behavior, and status. Jordan-Young and Karkazis brilliantly show how a wide range of popular beliefs and scientific research about testosterone support dangerous gender, race, and class stereotypes that blame biological differences for inequalities of power. They compel us to think more critically not only about T, but also, more broadly, about the fraught relationship between biology and social identity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Dorothy Roberts, author of <i>Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Re-create Race in the Twenty-First Century</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A brilliant book. With a rare combination of meticulous scholarship and page-turner style, Jordan-Young and Karkazis unravel, dissect, and ultimately explode the traditional story of testosterone. This book provides a revelation on every page, and readers will finish with a far richer understanding of the complexities of both testosterone and science.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Cordelia Fine, author of <i>Testosterone Rex: Myths of Sex, Science, and Society</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Testosterone: An Unauthorized Biography</i> shines an urgently needed light on our collective, troubling myth-making about a hormone blamed for everything from male aggression to unfair advantage in athletic competition. Through rigorous analysis and a transcendent examination of cultural narratives, it not only reexamines and challenges some of our core beliefs about T; it also traces the way bias about gender is foundational to the science used to uphold those narratives. Eye-opening, accessible, and intelligent, this book will change the way you think about masculinities, race and class, and maybe even your own body.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Thomas Page McBee, author of <i>Amateur: A Reckoning with Gender, Identity, and Masculinity</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Testosterone science does not mix well with biases, social preconceptions, and politics of all sorts.

Just four years later in October 1928, the Hydes, a bright, attractive, and talented young couple built their own wooden sweep scow and launched on a honeymoon voyage down the Green and Colorado Rivers through Grand Canyon. Bessie was the first woman to ever attempt the river. Halfway through Grand Canyon they talked to the press, then disappeared into the gloomy November depths of the gorge. They were never seen again. Despite an extensive series of searches, no trace was found except, eerily, their boat: upright, intact, fully loaded, and snagged in calm water. Glen and Bessie had vanished without a trace. For the next seven decades their tale evolved from simple facts to convoluted folklore and myth. A woman appeared on a river trip in 1971 claiming to be Bessie, having murdered Glen and hiked out. In 1976 a skeleton was found at Grand Canyon with a bullet through the skull. Size, age and circumstance suggested it was the body of Glen Hyde. In 1985 a woman surfaced with a tale of her father, Glenn Hyde, who had disappeared in 1928, but reappeared seven years later with tales of having rafted rivers. He said he had attempted the Colorado through Grand Canyon but &#34;it didn&#39;t work out.&#34; And he carried a scar on his back from a knife wound, delivered by a woman named Bessie. And in 1992, when Georgie Clark, the most famous of all river runners, died, her past was discovered to be pure fiction. She had been born Bessie, and her lingerie drawer held a marriage record for Glen and Bessie Hyde. And a pistol. Author and boatman Brad Dimock tackled this story with an obsession, tracking each clue, lead, and rumor, even going to the extreme of building a replica of the Hydes&#39; archaic sweep scow for a harrowing journey through Grand Canyon with his own bride. The resulting book, a masterful interweaving of past and present, of pathos and humor, is a classic in outdoor adventure, mystery writing, literary nonfiction, and investigative journalism. With 304 profusely illustrated pages, this beautiful book is not only a joy to look at, but a true page turner.</p><p>Like The Perfect Storm on a whitewater river, or Into the Wild in the depths of Grand Canyon, this adventure/mystery/biography details true story of Glen and Bessie Hyde, who vanished on their 1928 honeymoon river trip through Grand Canyon. Although their boat was found upright and fully loaded, not a trace of the Hydes was ever found. Over the next seven decades four people&#x2014;each thought to be Glen or Bessie&#x2014;appeared, spawning tales of murder and mayhem. Award-winning author and boatman Brad Dimock tracked down each detail of the story, even going so far as to recreate the Hydes&#x2019; archaic scow for a harrowing journey through Grand Canyon with his own bride.It is an honor to be the carrier of a tale as rich, heartwarming, heartbreaking, and utterly astonishing as that of Glen and Bessie Hyde. During the two years it took to reseach and write this I had the great fortune to meet several people who still remembered parts of the story first-hand. Michael Harrison, at 102 years old, told me great tales of the search for the Hydes and described in detatil the other characters involved. And Glen Hyde&#39;s own nephew surfaced, the only living link to the family tragedy, and shared not only memories of his uncle and family photographs, but gave me insight into the true hero of the story, Glen Hyde&#39;s father, Rollin C. Hyde.</p><h2>The Knights of Bushido: A History of Japanese War Crimes During World War II</h2><p>The war crimes trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo meted out the Allies&#x2019; official justice; Lord Russell of Liverpool&#x2019;s sensational bestselling books on Germany&#x2019;s and Japan&#x2019;s war crimes decided the public&#x2019;s opinion. <i>The Knights of Bushido</i>, Russell&#x2019;s account of Japanese brutality in the Pacific in World War II, carefully compiles evidence given at the trials themselves. Russell describes how the noble founding principles of the Empire of Japan were perverted by the military into a systematic campaign of torture, murder, starvation, rape, and destruction. Notorious incidents like the Nanking Massacre and the Bataan Death March emerge as merely part of a pattern.<br><br>With a new introduction for this edition, <i>The Knights of Bushido</i> details the horrors perpetrated by a military caught up in an ideological fervor. Often expecting death, the Japanese flouted the Geneva Convention (which they refused to ratify). They murdered aircrews, bayoneted prisoners, carried out arbitrary decapitations, and practiced medical vivisection. Undoubtedly formidable soldiers, the Japanese were terrible conquerors. Their conduct in the Pacific is a harrowing example of the doctrine of mutual destruction carried to the extreme, and begs the question of what is acceptable and unacceptable in total war.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

She has been able to sense the unseen world of passed-on relatives, angels, and ghosts since childhood. Training as a Spiritualist Medium as an adult, she became a popular platform Medium and healer in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2009, she took a fateful trip to Italy&#x2019;s Tuscany Region, which would have a lasting impact far beyond what she could have ever imagined: Goddesses from Italy's history suddenly began appearing to Karyn as clearly as other spirit people had, and they began transmitting to her the information of a most interesting cultural melting pot in Italy that gave rise to its unique and complex spiritual landscape. Among the information shared was the knowledge of Italy's own indigenous Lineage healing: a female shamanism hiding in-plain-sight that can be traced back to pre-pagan times. One thing was clear: Mediumship was and is the cornerstone of all these traditions, and it function has been to advance the quality of life through the process of channeling, whereby previously hidden knowledge from the spirit world is handed down to earthly women. Following the guidance of the Goddesses, Karyn returned to Italy where she embarked on a long and intensive research study. Taking cures from "streghe," meeting herbalists on mountain tops, experiencing a 6 hour ancestral fire ritual with secret shaman called Benandanti, having a past-life curse released through making "occhi," interviewing local authors and museum curators, archivists, folk lore experts, and Inquisition researchers, living among locals and walking on the remains of the Goddess Diana's 2,000 year old temple, Karyn found the historical evidence to support what the Goddesses had shown her in visions. Italy&#x2019;s Witches and Medicine Women Volume 1 not only documents the information Karyn gathered through the 23 people she interviewed, but it also provides a comprehensive spiritual history of the "Italian Witch" and reveals an important matrilineal living practice supplanted by the patriarchal invasions of pre-pagan times, whose acts of repression still affect the world today. Along with documentation of a groundbreaking history of women, you will also find practical tips on how to prepare yourself to reconnect with this female Lineage. Between each chapters Karyn reveals her visionary journey to this evidential history in short stories called "Secrets," sure to bring understanding and illumination to your journey into the world of Spirit. Karyn has also developed "Italy's Witches and Medicine Women" into a Lecture Series with video interview footage, photos, and a brief overview of the enormous body of information her book contains.</p><p>Karyn Crisis trained as a platform Medium under an NSAC certified Spiritualist Minister, and she has become sought-after in the Bay Area for classes, workshops, private readings and public demonstrations. Her work has taken a turn towards historical recovery focused on reclaiming Ancient Wisdom received through the Old Ways. This feminine, receptive practice of devotional Mediumship offers empowerment in our modern times through connecting us to our still-living legacy of the Medicine Women, Wise Women, and &#x201c;Witches&#x201d; of the past, as well as to their Goddess Guides and Teachers.

Written in a warm and easily accessible style, this book appeals to anyone with an interest in meditation, Zen, or, as is often the case today, a combination of the two. The book emphasizes the importance of receiving good instruction and of finding groups to practice with, yet it lays out the necessary steps to practice Zen meditation on your own. The book includes easily followed exercises to help the reader along. For anyone looking to uncover a clear and insightful path into the philosophy and practice of Zen meditation, this book represents the culmination of that search.</p><p>The jolt of confidence you get when discussing a day's performance with a seasoned veteran can take any activity to a higher level. In his concise and informative <i>Zen Meditation in Plain English</i>, meditation veteran John Daishin Buksbazen gives detailed directions for each step of Zen-style meditation, from getting into the different postures and developing breath concentration, all the way up to intensive training periods.

He also offers a rare introduction to the importance and mechanics of group practice and a well-selected "Frequently Asked Questions" section at the end.

Those who recite it in Arabic are always eager to do more, aware of its inimitable clarity, rhythm and brevity, yet modern English readers have had limited access to its meanings, with most reliant upon translations prepared in archaic English, unappealing to the contemporary reader.</p> <p>In this new translation the renowned author and scholar Adil Salahi has endeavoured to put the meanings of the Qur&#x2019;anic verses and surahs in simple and straightforward form, so that the 21st century reader may find it concise easy to access, and yet full of expansive expression.</p></p><p>Adil Salahi's writings include the acclaimed <i>Muhammad: Man and Prophet</i> and <i>Pioneers of Islamic Scholarship</i>, and the English translation of the 18-volume <i>In the Shade of the Qur'an</i>. His main career has been in radio and print journalism, and for over 30 years he was editor of 'Islam in Perspective', a twice-weekly full-page column in the Arab News, a Saudi daily newspaper.<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Qur'an is God&#x2019;s word which He revealed to Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. God had earlier revealed scriptures to different prophets, including the Torah, the Psalms and the Gospel. The Qur&#x2019;an is clearly intended to be God&#x2019;s final message to mankind, setting out the way of life God wants people to lead. It sets their lives on the right course and ensures their happiness in this world and the next. In this present life, they have through God&#x2019;s message what gives them satisfaction of their physical and spiritual needs, as well as a sense of complete fulfilment. Implementation of the Qur'an in this present life ensures for them admittance into heaven in the life to come. This means a second life of perfect bliss and happiness, as well as enjoyment of what is even better, namely that God is pleased with them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Qur&#x2019;an was revealed in parts during the period from the beginning of Muhammad&#x2019;s prophethood in 610 to shortly before he passed away in 632. Although the revelations given to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) included much more than the Qur&#x2019;an. The Qur&#x2019;an is given in God&#x2019;s own word, while the rest of His revelation was expressed by Prophet Muhammad in his words and style. The two complement each other and together form the Islamic message.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Qur&#x2019;an is God&#x2019;s own word, and it has been preserved in its original form over the fourteen centuries of Islamic history. This is due, first and foremost, to the fact that God has guaranteed its preservation: &#x2018;It is We Ourselves who have bestowed this reminder from on high, and it is We who shall preserve it intact&#x2019;. (15: 9) When the Prophet received a surah or a passage of the Qur&#x2019;an, he immediately dictated it to one or more of his scribes. Many of his companions memorised it. When he passed away, his successor as head of the Muslim state, Abu Bakr, ordered the collation of a complete copy of the Qur&#x2019;an to serve as reference. This was a meticulous exercise completed during Abu Bakr&#x2019;s reign which lasted less than two years. The task was entrusted to Zayd ibn Thabit who had learnt the complete Qur&#x2019;an by heart under the Prophet&#x2019;s own instruction and guidance. Zayd gathered the written parts together, requiring two independent witnesses to testify that they were present when the Prophet dictated it to the scribe who kept it. Thus, authenticity was perfectly assured through the four people involved up to that point: the scribe, the two witnesses and Zayd, plus the written copy. However, Abu Bakr, [Umar, [Uthman and [Ali, all of whom knew the full Qur&#x2019;an by heart, further checked the complete copy. The whole exercise was repeated again less than fifteen years later, when reference copies were produced by a committee headed by Zayd himself and who was helped by three more of the Prophet&#x2019;s companions who also knew the Qur&#x2019;an by heart. These copies were checked against the original copy collated during Abu Bakr&#x2019;s reign. A copy was then sent to each of the main cities of the Muslim state, with a reciter who memorised the Qur&#x2019;an in full to teach people its proper recitation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Qur&#x2019;an is recited every day by every Muslim who keeps up his or her prayer. It is recited in prayer and at other times, because its recitation is an act of worship. Millions of people have learned its entirety by heart throughout every generation since it was first revealed 1,400 years ago. Nearly every Muslim memorises parts of it, and most recite a portion of it every day. Those who know it by heart read it in full once a week in order to retain it in their immediate memory. None feels this to be a demanding task, even though it takes at least an hour and a half every day. On the contrary, they approach it with the eagerness of one who feels it adds to their happiness.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>No religious book is read and recited or listened to as frequently as the Qur&#x2019;an. Yet those who recite it are always eager to do more. The question is whether this is due only to the religious aspect or if there is something more about the Qur&#x2019;an? The religious factor is undoubtedly very important, but what is there about the Qur&#x2019;an that attracts non-Muslim Arabs to memorise some passages of it? Indeed, some of them read it in its entirety time after time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We need to remember that the Qur&#x2019;an was revealed during a time when the Arabs were very proud of their language and used it so skilfully as to include fine forms of expressive speech. Moreover, they attached great importance to poetry. As they were largely unlettered people, poetry was the way they recorded their history, highlighted their bright moments, expressed their sorrows, extolled the merits of their departed elders, described their happiest events, reviled their enemies and recorded the lessons they learnt through hard experience. They chanted it in their social gatherings, and through poetry their news travelled from one part of Arabia to another. It also served as their formal and social media. What is special about Arabic poetry is that a poem may run into hundreds of lines, maintaining the same metre and rhyme, without giving even a hint of affectation or the rhyming word sounding laboured. In this they benefited by the fact that Arabic is a derivative language, which means that a three-consonant root can generate words in double figures in the forms of verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs bearing the same meaning as the root and adding varying connotations.</p> <p>For example, if we take the Arabic root <em>h</em><em>-d-th</em>, meaning to do and to speak, we may derive the following fifteen words: happened, narrated, speaker, interlocutor, spokesman, spoken statement, converse, conversation, accident, recent, made something new, invented a new thing, event, innovated, recently, and the causer of an event.[1] Furthermore, the root will also provide several more words delivering yet greater subtleties in each instance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the tribal society of Arabia, with tribes often raiding each other for plunder or revenge, the rise of a poet was an occasion for great celebration, because he could always highlight the merits of his tribe and revile its opponents. The fact that poetry is easily memorised and survives for a considerable length of time added to its importance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) recited passages of the Qur&#x2019;an to the Arabs, in his efforts to advocate his message, they could not place it in any form of speech they knew. For certain, they realised that, despite its use of rhyme at times and having rhythm, it was not poetry. The Prophet appreciated poetry and could distinguish what was fine and what was of low standard, and he listened to some recitals of fine poetry, but he never expressed himself in any form that could be described as akin to poetry. He did not even quote any line of poetry in his speech. Discerning Arabs were quick to recognise that the Qur&#x2019;an was of a much superior quality than even the finest of their poetry. Hence, when anyone suggested that his opponents should describe Muhammad as a poet, the suggestion was rejected out of hand. Having listened to two passages of the Qur&#x2019;an, al-Mafruq ibn [Amr, the head of the major Arabian tribe, the Shayban, said to the Prophet: &#x2018;What you say is not the word of a human being. Had it been human speech we would have recognised it&#x2019;.[2]</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the finest aspects of the Qur&#x2019;an&#x2019;s style is the combination of word economy and expansive expression. Many literary critics have expressed wonder at how the Qur&#x2019;an presents its ideas with the number of words it uses: it is a case of full meaning with minimum words, and this is consistent throughout, even when it provides detailed legislation. One clear example is the system of inheritance which assigns shares to different heirs, covering all situations and relations that may arise in any family and leaving no room for dispute. The whole system is outlined in verses 11, 12 and 176 of the fourth surah, Women. Together these verses use no more than 209 words in 22 lines.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Qur&#x2019;an tells stories of earlier prophets and their communities. Brevity is again a main feature of its style. In the story of the birth of Jesus in Surah 19, only seven words separate the angel&#x2019;s announcement to Mary that he was to give her a son and her being in labour. Yet her trouble at her virgin pregnancy and the need to hide from curious eyes is perfectly accounted for. Surah 12 devotes 98 of its 111 verses to the story of Prophet Joseph, from his childhood to the reunion with his parents after he was appointed to a high position in the government of Egypt. The story runs in 28 scenes and there are gaps between some of them and at times the gap could stretch over several years. Yet at no point does the reciter or the listener feel that any part of the story is left out. On the contrary, they feel that they are given all necessary details. For example, one scene closes with Joseph&#x2019;s brothers in Egypt finding themselves at a loss because of the arrest of their youngest brother when they had most solemnly pledged to their father that they would return him safely. Their eldest is telling them to go back and explain what happened to their father and give him all the necessary evidence confirming the truth of their report. The next scene opens immediately, with their father giving his reaction to their report. Thus, their journey from Egypt to Palestine, their feelings as they arrived, their reluctance to speak to their father as they were conscious of their guilt over Joseph&#x2019;s disappearance are all left out, but the story is felt to be complete. Furthermore, the story identifies lessons to be learned and clearly illustrates concepts for believers to uphold.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A unique feature of the Qur&#x2019;an&#x2019;s style is that outlined by Sayyid Qutb in his pioneering work <em>Artistic Imagery in the Qur&#x2019;an</em>, published in 1945. Qutb says:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Painting images is the Qur&#x2019;an&#x2019;s preferred method of expression. It presents abstract concepts, psychological feelings, real events, visible scenes, people&#x2019;s types and human nature in clear images that we can mentally see before us. It then gives the painted image real life and successive movement. It thus gives the abstract idea shape or movement; presents a psychological feeling in a scene or a painting; shows human nature and types of people alive before our very eyes. Events, scenes and stories are all shown full of life and movement. When dialogue is added to these, all elements are completed for us to imagine what is on show. Once the Qur&#x2019;an starts its presentation of these, the reciter and listeners become the audience watching the story unfold. They are transported to the stage where the story took place or where the event will happen. As one scene or movement follows another, listeners forget that they are merely listening to words being recited. Instead, they feel that they are actually watching those very scenes and events.[3]</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An excellent translator will be able to express the ideas and meanings of the author and put these in a way that enables the reader in the target language to fully understand the original text. However, each language has its own characteristics and what is easily manipulated in one language may not be achievable in another. This feature of the Qur&#x2019;anic style is one of the difficulties that a translator of the Qur&#x2019;an faces.</p> <p>Another aspect of the Qur&#x2019;anic style is its rhythm. Rhythm runs throughout the Qur&#x2019;an, and it varies to suit the nature of the surah and its subject matter. Indeed it varies within the same surah, even in shorter ones. Sometimes the beat is strong and fast, while at others it is soft and slow. At other times these two combinations are reversed. Yet there is no metre to adhere to anywhere. Arabic poetry has no less than 17 different metres, but none of them is employed in the Qur&#x2019;an. Nevertheless, one only needs to listen to the Qur&#x2019;an being recited by an expert reciter to realise that music runs throughout it. At least two translators of the Qur&#x2019;an were largely motivated to undertake the task by their love of its music. These were the late Arthur Arberry and N.J. Dawood; neither of whom was a Muslim, and both tried to give rhythm to their texts, despite the fact that their approaches were fundamentally different. In several conversations with Mr Dawood, he spoke to me about his feelings when he listened to a good recitation of the Qur&#x2019;an. Professor Arberry wrote in the Introduction to his translation:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a repertory of familiar themes running through the whole Koran; each Sura elaborates or adumbrates one or more &#x2013; often many &#x2013; of these. Using the language of music, each Sura is a rhapsody composed of whole or fragmentary leitmotivs; the analogy is reinforced by the subtly varied rhythmical flow of the discourse...</p> <p>During the long months, the dark and light months, of labouring at this interpretation... I have been reliving those Ramadan nights of long ago, when I would sit on the veranda of my Gezira[4] house and listen entranced to the old, white-bearded Sheykh who chanted the Koran for the pious delectation of my neighbour.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We may say that the superior literary excellence of the Qur&#x2019;anic style, its brevity, music and other unique aspects make the Qur&#x2019;an very hard to translate, or even &#x2018;untranslatable&#x2019;. Yet there has been no shortage of attempts to translate the Qur&#x2019;an. The first English translation by George Sale was published in 1734, followed in 1861 by Rodwell&#x2019;s and in 1880 by Palmer&#x2019;s.

He recounts how the studio system rose out of the ashes of Thomas Edison's trust to create the handful of companies that have dominated global screens and imaginations for more than 100 years. Throughout, he reveals that the elements we take to be a natural part of the Hollywood experience--stars, genre-driven storytelling, blockbuster franchises, etc.--are really the product of cultural, political, and commercial forces. <br><br>In many ways, Hollywood has remained the same for over a century. It has always been a global industry based in the U.S., and its storytelling has always unfolded across media, adapting plays, book, and comics and spinning off product tie-ins, television series, and social media campaigns. But major events have also continually remade Hollywood. The studios have weathered wars, disruptive new technologies, and competition by adopting a strategy of risk management and assimilation. This book explores the challenges of new technologies, including sound, home video, and computer graphics. And it examines Hollywood's responses to World War II, independent film movements, and regulations imposed by Washington.<br><br><em>Hollywood: A Very Short Introduction</em> is filled with discussions of well-known movies, stars, and directors, encapsulating the past century of research on Hollywood while adding many original insights and stories.

If you love movies you'll love this book." --Dick Wolf, producer of <em>Law &amp; Order</em><p></p><br>"Peter Decherney - setting the scene by pointing out how unnatural, crisis-prone and risky a business Hollywood has always been - weaves a beguiling narrative. He takes the reader from the days of Edison's kinetoscope to digital post-production equipment, always alert to the fact that this now century-old success story which is the American film industry only survived the many changes in technology, business models and audience tastes, because it held fast to a few fundamental principles, such as keeping corporate control, managing risk and extending audience access.

It is a narrative profoundly tied to a particular place, but it is also a story of encounters with outsiders who often mediate or meddle in the rice enterprise. Although the focal point is a remote area of West Africa, the book illuminates the more universal nexus of identity, environment, and development, especially in an era when many people--rural and urban--are confronting environmental changes that challenge their livelihoods and lifestyles.<br></p><p><br><strong>Joanna Davidson</strong> is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Boston University.<br><br>"The use of rice as a single master trope offers a focal point that ties together both the personal narratives of the main characters and the contexts relevant to understanding and explaining the situations in which they find themselves.

At the editing table, when I run the strip of film through, frame by frame, I still feel that dizzy sense of magic of my childhood.&#x201d; Bergman, who has conveyed this heady sense of wonder and vision to moviegoers for decades, traces his lifelong love affair with film in his breathtakingly visual autobiography, <i>The Magic Lantern</i>.<br> <br> More grand mosaic than linear account, Bergman&#x2019;s vignettes trace his life from a rural Swedish childhood through his work in theater to Hollywood&#x2019;s golden age, and a tumultuous romantic history that includes five wives and more than a few mistresses. Throughout, Bergman recounts his life in a series of deeply personal flashbacks that document some of the most important moments in twentieth-century filmmaking as well as the private obsessions of the man behind them. Ambitious in scope yet sensitively wrought, <i>The Magic Lantern</i> is a window to the mind of one of our era&#x2019;s great geniuses.</p> <p>&#x201c;[Bergman] has found a way to show the soul&#x2019;s landscape . . . .

No &#x2018;tell-all&#x2019; book this one, but revealing in ways that much longer and allegedly &#x2018;franker&#x2019; books are not.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p>Ingmar Bergman is perhaps the greatest living filmmaker, having written and directed the masterpieces &#34;The Seventh Seal,&#34; &#34;Wild Strawberries,&#34; &#34;Through a Glass Darkly,&#34; &#34;Cries and Whispers,&#34; &#34;Scenes From a Marriage,&#34; &#34;Fanny and Alexander&#34; and many others. In this autobiography, Bergman focuses more on his personal than his professional life, offering the reader an unusually intimate portrait of a troubled and prolific artistic psyche.<p><b>Ingmar Bergman </b>is a Swedish filmmaker who has written and directed over fifty films.&nbsp; He is the recipient of three Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film for <i>The Virgin Spring</i>, <i>Through a Glass Darkly</i>, and <i>Fanny and Alexander.</i></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Joan Tate </b>(1922&#x2013;2000) was a prolific translator of Swedish works into English.</p></p><h2>Excelability in Advanced Latin: A Workbook for Students</h2><p>This workbook for third and fourth year high school Latin students is designed to assist students in reading Latin. A broad selection of Latin authors and texts, only four of which are unadapted, provide practice in reading Latin for comprehension. In addition, the first ten chapters systematically review all of Latin grammar. Two chapters present rhetorical devices, scansion and meter, along with passages for reading comprehension. The passages are taken from a wide variety of genres and texts and offer practice for students preparing to take the SAT II, the National Latin Exam, and the Advanced Placement Latin Literature tests. Every chapter contains exercises for practice and the grammatical and syntactical explanations are keyed to an appendix which contains the forms of Latin words.</p><p>Lest title or names of authors should leave you in any doubt, this is a book from the states, and very much aimed at the US market. The bulk of the book is a review of grammar, accompanied by a wide range of passages from both prose and verse authors. These are used to focus students on specific grammar points, although there is also a wider aim to work on fluent reading at sight. The explanations seem clear enough, perhaps with a little more formality than CLC.<p>Much use is made of both multiple choice and then comprehension questions focused on the topic under consideration. There is certainly plenty to make students think about the language and teachers might well find they could make selective use of material to supplement their chosen course. There is a particularly interesting section on rhetorical devices, metre and scansion, once again accompanied by a range of passages to illustrate and test. This is followed by a section of comprehension passages, which might well be used to ease students into working on unseens, with questions on both grammar and content.</p><p>Finally, there is a selection of free response passages, that is, a passage followed by 2 or 3 short essay questions for students to get their teeth into after 13 sections of carefully guided and focused work. --Tim Wheeler, JACT</p></p><h2>Comparative Law in a Changing World</h2><p><p>Providing a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the legal approach to key areas of law within different legal systems, this book offers a blueprint for comparative legal study by evaluating the current epistemological debate on comparative law and comparative legal research methods.</p> <p>Substantive law, the law of obligations, commercial and corporate law within the major legal systems of the world are all examined and compared. While France and Germany are generally used as the archetypal civil law jurisdictions and English law as the main common law comparator, this third edition also examines the Russian Federation in the post-Soviet era and socialist legal influences as well as non-Western legal traditions. Fully updated and revised to include all recent developments, this edition also includes a broad historical introduction and outlines changes in EC Law. </p> <p>It assesses the possibility of Europeanization of national legal systems and certain legal topics, the impact of the globalization of legal institutions and the evolving 'new world order' in the early twenty-first century. </p> <p>Written in a clear, user-friendly style, <em>Comparative Law in a Changing World</em> is an accessible source for undergraduates and postgraduates wishing to trace the influence of common law and civil law legal traditions on jurisdictions across the world.</p></p><p><p></p> <p>Peter de Cruz is Professor of Law at Liverpool John Moores University.</p>Praise for the first edition; &#39;The first edition of this lucidly written, helpfully and logically structured, sensibly indexed, and very scholarly book, packed with so much knowledge from so many sources, was an enormous help to teachers and students of comparative law both at under-graduate and post-graduate levels. It assisted lecturers in other subjects including contract, tort, sale of goods, and employment to add an authoritative comparative element to their course. The second edition, which takes into account subsequent events, developments and currents of thought, further enhances it great value.

It was a period when the African-American came of age, with the clearest expression of this transformation visible in the remarkable outpouring of literature, art, and music. In these years the "New Negro" was born, as seen in the shift of black leadership from Booker T. Washington to that of W.E.B. Du Bois, from Tuskegee to New York, and for some, even to the African nationalism of Marcus Garvey.<br><br>In <em>Voices from the Harlem Renaissance</em>, Nathan Irvin Huggins provides more than 120 selections from the political writings and arts of the period, each depicting the meaning of blackness and the nature of African-American art and its relation to social statement. Through these pieces, Huggins establishes the context in which the art of Harlem Renaissance occurred. We read the call to action by pre-Renaissance black spokesmen, such as A. Philip Randolph and W.E.B. DuBois who--through magazines such as The Messenger ("the only radical Negro magazine"), and the NAACP's Crisis--called for a radical transformation of the American economic and social order so as to make a fair world for black men and women. We hear the more flamboyant rhetoric of Marcus Garvey, who rejected the idea of social equality for a completely separate African social order. And we meet Alain Locke, whose work served to redefine the "New Negro" in cultural terms, and stands as the cornerstone of the Harlem Renaissance. <br><br>Huggins goes on to offer autobiographical writings, poetry, and stories of such men and women as Langston Hughes, Nancy Cunard, Helen Johnson, and Claude McKay--writings that depict the impact of Harlem and New York City on those who lived there, as well as the youthfulness and exuberance of the period. The complex question of identity, a very important part of the thought and expression of the Harlem Renaissance, is addressed in work's such as Jean Toomer's Bona and Paul and Zora Neale Hurston's Sweat. And Huggins goes on to attend to the voices of alienation, anger, and rage that appeared in a great deal of the writing to come out of the Harlem Renaissance by poets such as George S. Schuyler and Gwendolyn Bennett. Also included are over twenty illustrations by such artists as Aaron Douglas whose designs illuminated many of the works we associate with the Harlem Renaissance: the magazines Fire and Harlem; Alain Locke's The New Negro; and James Weldon Johnson's God's Trombones.<br><br>The vitality of the Harlem Renaissance served as a generative force for all New York--and the nation. Offering all those interested in the evolution of African-American consciousness and art a link to this glorious time, <em>Voices from the Harlem Renaissance</em> illuminates the African-American struggle for self-realization.<br></p><p>The Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s symbolized black liberation and sophistication - the final shaking off of slavery from the minds, spirits, and characters of African Americans.

While focusing on the youthfulness and exuberance of the period, Huggins attends to the voices of alienation, anger, and rage - whether softly intoned or stridently voiced - so widely reflected in the writing of poets such as George S. Schuyler and Gwendolyn Bennett. Also included are over twenty paintings and sculptures of the Renaissance period by such artists as Aaron Douglas, Sargent Johnson, and Hale Woodruff.

It was, as Elliott West shows, a tale of courage and ingenuity, of desperate struggle and shattered hope, of short-sighted government action and a doomed flight to freedom. <br><br>To tell the story, West begins with the early history of the Nez Perce and their years of friendly relations with white settlers. In an initial treaty, the Nez Perce were promised a large part of their ancestral homeland, but the discovery of gold led to a stampede of settlement within the Nez Perce land. Numerous injustices at the hands of the US government combined with the settlers' invasion to provoke this most accomodating of tribes to war. West offers a riveting account of what came next: the harrowing flight of 800 Nez Perce, including many women, children and elderly, across 1500 miles of mountainous and difficult terrain. He gives a full reckoning of the campaigns and battles--and the unexpected turns, brilliant stratagems, and grand heroism that occurred along the way. And he brings to life the complex characters from both sides of the conflict, including cavalrymen, officers, politicians, and--at the center of it all--the Nez Perce themselves (the <em>Nimiipuu</em>, "true people"). The book sheds light on the war's legacy, including the near sainthood that was bestowed upon Chief Joseph, whose speech of surrender, "I will fight no more forever," became as celebrated as the Gettysburg Address. <br><br>Based on a rich cache of historical documents, from government and military records to contemporary interviews and newspaper reports, <em>The Last Indian War</em> offers a searing portrait of a moment when the American identity--who was and who was not a citizen--was being forged.<br></p><p><br><strong>Elliott West</strong> is Professor of American History at the University of Arkansas.<br><br>"A distinguished scholar of American history makes a significant contribution to Oxford's excellent series Pivotal Moments in American History in this definitive analysis of the United States' 1877 war with the Nez Perc�... The 1877 war, the Nez Perc�'s epic journey to reach the Canadian border, American conquest and Indian exile is the heart of the book, and West tells it brilliantly."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> starred review<p></p><br>"Elliott West's <em>The Last Indian War</em> illustrates his leadership among western historians... this new volume exhibits West's superb talents as a thoughtful, analytical, and artistic historian at home in the West ... West's book is now the best account we have of the much-discussed Nez Perce War and the role of the Nez Perce leader Joseph in this conflict... But <em>The Last Indian War</em> is much more than another account of the Nez Perce War. If read carefully and thoughtfully, West's benchmark volume will force general and specialist readers to reconfigure American history of the mid-nineteenth century... In short, <em>The Last Indian War</em> is a major work of both revision and narration. Western as well as American historians will find West's volume of first importance in rethinking the mid-nineteenth century. Quite simply, West's premier book is worthy of all the accolades and major prizes it will garner."--Richard W. Etulain, <em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"Gripping...Skilled storytelling drives an astute examination of a sad, complicated episode."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"It is fascinating history, well-documented...

That theme becomes a drumbeat as he scrutinizes every detail of the Nez Perce war, flight, capture and exile."--<em>Tacoma News Tribune</em><p></p><br>"This is an excellent study of the relations between whites and the Nez Perce tribe, with emphasis on the 1877 war."--<em>True West</em> magazine<p></p><br>"Based on extensive research in archival papers, government reports, and contemporary sources, this well-written book is an excellent place to start in understanding the Nez Perce War and is highly recommended for all libraries."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Using historical documents, from government and military records to contemporary interviews and newspaper reports, 'The Last Indian War' offers a portrait of emerging American identity - when the idea of who was and who was not a citizen was being forged...Complex characters on both sides of the following battles are brought to life. The book sheds light on the war's legacy, including the near sainthood bestowed upon Chief Joseph."--<em>Lewiston Tribune</em><p></p><br>"No one writes Western history better than Elliott West. Here he puts the Nez Perce story into the broad context of U.S. national integration while retaining its vivid specificity. A gripping account for both academic and general audiences."--Daniel Walker Howe, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>What</em> <em>Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848</em><p></p><br>"In Elliott West's skilled hands, the plangent tale of Chief Joseph and the great hegira of his people comes to immediate life on the page." --Hampton Sides, author of <em>Blood and Thunder</em><p></p><br>"Powerful and elegant, informative and highly readable, Elliott West's <em>The Last Indian War</em> is one of the most distinguished works on its subject to appear in 30 years. Its core is a fascinating account of how some 800 Nez Perce outwitted the U.S. Army over a 1500-mile retreat. Indians and white army officers, soldiers, politicians and local settlers-all become flesh and blood, revealing not only West's profound understanding of Indian culture but his ability to put them within the context our national history as it was becoming a modern industrial nation."--Howard R. Lamar, Sterling Professor Emeritus of History, Yale University<p></p><br>"With his extraordinary gifts for conveying the character of the people of the past and for untangling--but never over-simplifying--the most complex of stories, Elliott West uncovers the unifying patterns in the Civil War and the Indian Wars, the Reconstruction of the South and the incorporation of the West."--Patricia Nelson Limerick, Center of the American West, University of Colorado<p></p><br>"No one has ever told the story of the Nez Perce so compellingly and so movingly-and many have told it. Even more impressively, West makes this wry, tragic, and deeply humane volume a window onto the wider changes transforming the United States. His idea of a Greater Reconstruction provides a framework for future histories of the era."--Richard White, Professor of History, Stanford University<p></p><br>"In West's sweeping narrative, the destinies of Nez Perce warriors and American officers entwine as they struggle for mastery of some of the continent's choice land. In the hands of one of our greatest western historians, the last Indian war is no longer an isolated event on the edge of American history, but goes to the heart of the central question of just who was welcome in modern America, and under what terms."--Heather Cox Richardson, author of <em>West From Appomattox</em><p></p><br>"The Nez Perces never wanted war and their history was embedded in the glorious and forbidding geography of the high country of Idaho and Montana for a millennia. Elliott West, one of the most versatile and distinguished historians of the American West, tells this riveting epic story of land, greed, race, and warfare. All whites are not villains and all Indians are not heroic in this saga; but the tragedy of the pursuit and destruction of Chief Joseph and his people by the relentless logic of war is rooted in a U.S. government policy of conquest and racial dominance that we must still reckon with today.

Four decades later, United Farm Workers leader Cesar Chavez's likeness graces postage stamps, and schools and streets are renamed in his honor.<br>But the real stories behind la causa-both its historic accomplishments and tragic disintegration-have remained buried. Pulitzer-winning journalist Miriam Pawel has changed our understanding of the UFW forever, crafting a powerful, poignant account of a movement and the people who made it. A tour de force of reporting and a spellbinding narrative, <i>The Union of Their Dreams</i> is a major contribution to the history of labor, civil rights, and immigration in modern America.</p></p><p><p><b>Miriam Pawel </b>is an award-winning reporter and editor who spent twenty-five years working for <i>Newsday </i>and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. She was recently an Alicia Patterson Foundation Fellow and a John Jacobs Fellow at the Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies.</p><p>&#x201c;One of the most important recent books on California history, Miriam Pawel has undertaken a thankless task: telling a complicated and in many ways shattering truth ... exhaustively researched, by turns sympathetic and deeply shocking ... Pawel describes the reality of the movement, not just during the well-studied and victorious period that made it famous, but during its long, painful transformation to what it is today. Her story of one man and his movement is a story of how the '60s became the '70s.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Caitlin Flanagan, Atlantic</i></p><p>&#x201c;Thoroughly researched and thoroughly unsentimental ...

It is a chronicle of great struggle, but also of hope.... <i>The Union of Their Dreams</i> takes an important step toward reminding Americans that, three decades on, La Causa very much remains.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>San Francisco Panorama</i></p><p>&#x201c;Pawel, drawing on and greatly expanding the research she did for the <i>L.A. Times</i> series, has come back for a second dipping with her engrossing and just as exquisitely assembled book... Her tack this time is quite different. Instead of a dry, almost legalistic indictment of the failings of the UFW, her approach now feels like the script of the great Costa-Gavras film <i>The Confession</i>, or like Arthur Koestler's classic anti-Stalinist memoir <i>Darkness at Noon</i>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>TruthDig.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;A revealing celebration of activists in the glory days of a movement for change.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Pawel combines document research with recent interviews with several former directors, legal staff, and rank and file, allowing her to present a thorough and convincing treatment of an important chapter in American history.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>School Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Steeped in the recordings and primary source materials from these years, Pawel recreates the era--but with an awareness of the ironies and contradictions made plainer by hindsight.... The book's unexpected scar tissue and its arc of decline present some contrast to the continuing if dispersed legacy trumpeted in Randy Shaw's recent Beyond the Fields, but these accounts are ultimately complementary and necessary historical revaluations of this important labor and social history.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>PublishersWeekly.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this sympathetic yet courageously honest narrative, a seasoned reporter presents the history behind the legend of Cesar Chavez and the Farm Workers Movement. At the same time, Miriam Pawel pays tribute to the dreams of a generation of young Americans dedicated to social justice and the dignity of labor.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kevin Starr, University of Southern California, author of Golden Dreams and California: A History</i></p><p>&#x201c;This incisive and sensitive study makes a major contribution to our understanding of Cesar Chavez and the poor people's movement he led. Moving beyond hagiography and mythology, Miriam Pawel gives new insight into the heroic struggles of some of the ordinary people who committed themselves, against unimaginable odds, to an extraordinary cause.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David G. Guti�rrez, University of California, San Diego</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Union of Their Dreams</i> captures in fascinating detail the human stories of diverse people and how they committed themselves to the movement. It also reveals the tensions and dissensions that were a part of the union and its leadership after the early years of its formation. This is an interesting and provocative book that expands our understanding of the union from inside out.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Albert M. Camarillo, Stanford University</i></p><p>&#x201c;Avoiding polemic or sensationalism, <i>The Union of Their Dreams</i> recounts for the first time how a cult of personality around Cesar Chavez (influenced by the practices of the sinister Synanon organization) ultimately betrayed the courage of the workers in the fields and the trust of a veteran organizing staff. The stories of lost campaigns and internal purges are painful, but they also transmit hugely important lessons about the necessary dialectic of militancy and democracy in labor struggles.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mike Davis, author of City of Quartz</i></p><p>&#x201c;Miriam Pawel combines the skills of an historian and an investigative reporter to tell the story of the remarkable people upon whose dreams the farm worker movement was established, moved forward, and forever changed the nation.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>William Deverell, Director, Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West</i></p><p>&#x201c;Anyone interested in political idealism, trade unions, leadership, mass movements, and even the Barack Obama phenomenon will have much to think about after reading this enthralling account of great accomplishment gained and lost.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Nicholas von Hoffman, author of Hoax and Citizen Cohn</i></p></p><h2>The Writer&#39;s Compass: From Story Map to Finished Draft in 7 Stages</h2><p><p><b>Map out your idea and finish your story in 7 stages!</b></p><p>This book will show writers how to develop their ideas into a finished novel by working through it in 7 stages, while learning how to mapping out their story's progress and structure so they can evaluate and improve their work.

Suddenly there comes a new challenger: Flame! An unproven racer, the Island Stallion can run like the wind and his jockey, Steve Duncan, knows that Flame will give the Black the race of his life. But what neither Steve nor Alec know, is that these two stallions have met before, and they hate each other.</p><p><b>Walter Farley</b>'s first book,&nbsp;<i>The Black Stallion</i>, was an instant hit when it appeared in 1941. Mr. Farley went on to write thirty-three other enormously popular books about the Black Stallion and other horses which were published in more than twenty countries. He died in 1989, shortly before the publication of his last novel,&nbsp;<i>The Young Black Stallion</i>, written with his son Steven."Dear Alec Ramsay," the letter began, "I've wanted to write you a long time but was afraid you'd be too busy even to read my letter. I finally decided I just had to take a chance and write anyway. I know there's no one else who would understand my love for a horse as much as you and I need your help very much."<br><br> Alec stopped reading and got off his seat on the tack trunk so the old man with him could rummage inside. "What are you looking for, Henry?" he asked.<br><br> "The X-ray plates Doc Palmer took," the trainer said.<br><br> "The latest batch?" Alec asked.<br><br> "Yeah, those."<br><br> "In the right-hand corner."<br><br> Removing the stack of negatives, the old man held them up to the morning sunlight coming through the doorway of the small room. He stared at the X rays, shook his head, then climbed up on the tack trunk and held the negatives against the bare light bulb.<br><br> "You won't find anything," Alec said. "You never do."<br><br> "There just might be a speck we missed."<br><br> "There's nothing," Alec insisted. "The Black's hoof healed long ago. We have the doc's word for it. We have clean pictures and we know he's acting right." Mounting impatience with the old man made him add, "I don't see why you keep looking for trouble, Henry. He was wild to run this morning. I haven't seen him act so alive and well in months."<br><br> "You let him get away from you," the old man said defensively. "You were supposed to take him for a sightseeing gallop and you didn't."<br><br> "I couldn't. As I say, he was wild. He felt good. He was bucking and playing all the way. You know yourself that he was still so fresh when we got back to the barn that it took the two of us to walk him."<br><br> "I know," the old man said, still studying the pictures.<br><br> Alec Ramsay turned back to the letter in his hand. "You want me to read this letter to you?"<br><br> "Why not? Don't you always read your fan mail to me?"<br><br> "But sometimes you don't listen."<br><br> "I'll listen. I can work at the same time." Henry Dailey held the X-ray negatives to the light bulb again and added, "Whoever is writing needs your help. Like maybe ten others a week you hear from. He loves horses as much as you do. Or maybe it's from a girl this time?"<br><br> Alec turned over the letter to read the signature. "No, it's from a fellow. Someone named Steve Duncan. But you're right so far . . . he loves horses as much as I do and he's asking for help."<br><br> "Want me to go on?" the old man asked without taking his eyes from the negatives. "I can tell you the rest of it, almost word for word."<br><br> "No, let me read it to you. Maybe it'll be different this time." But different or not, Alec decided it was good knowing people were interested enough in him and the Black to write. If the day ever came when he and Henry became too busy to read such letters, it would be time to quit racing altogether.<br><br> "From the newspapers I know you have the Black at Hialeah Park this winter and may race him before long," Alec read aloud. "I know exactly how you feel having such a wonderful horse and I wish . . ."<br><br> Henry stepped down from the tack trunk, replacing the X-ray negatives in a large manila envelope. "That fellow knows exactly how you feel having the Black, and he wants one exactly like him someday," he said. "You're not going to be able to help him any more than you did the others, Alec. How come people don't understand that a truly great horse like the Black turns up just once in a lifetime, if at all?"<br><br> Alec shrugged his shoulders as he met the old man's gaze. Henry's face had the texture of old parchment crisscrossed with a mass of wrinkles, but his eyes and voice still held the fire and gusto of youth.<br><br> "I'd pity most of them if they ever did have a horse like the Black," the old man went on. "They don't know what it's like having a great horse on their hands. They don't know any of the problems."<br><br> "Who're you kidding? You wouldn't change it for the world, Henry," Alec said.<br><br> "Of course not. I waited all my life for him to come along. Maybe I worry about him too much like you say," he went on. "Sometimes I think he's going to worry me to death. Sometimes I can't eat or sleep, just knowing I got the big one in my stable. That's the way it is, but I wouldn't wish it on anyone else."<br><br> Turning back to the letter, Alec said, "This fellow seems to have something else in mind."<br><br> ". . . and I wish," he continued reading, "that you and I could get together. I live in Miami now. My family moved here from the North last fall. It would be easy for me to get to Hialeah to see you. Would you mind if I came over soon? It's very important and I'm sure you could help me."<br><br> "That's great, just great," the old man said. "All we need around here is a horse-struck kid with a problem. Maybe he won't get past the barn gate."<br><br> "That doesn't sound like you, Henry," Alec said. "It won't do any harm to see him if he does come. I don't see what's wrong with you these days. You're too cautious about everything."<br><br> Henry straightened his blocklike figure, making a gallant attempt to look unconcerned at Alec's criticism and regain his position of authority. He didn't like the way Alec was sizing him up. Alec was too composed while he was squirming inwardly. Maybe it was a sign of old age creeping up on him. Maybe it wasn't a case of being as old as one felt but as old as one was.<br><br> "I guess you're right," he said finally. "I didn't mean it the way it sounded. We'll help him all we can."<br><br> Alec smiled, trying to make it easier for his old friend. He thought he knew how the trainer felt. The Black had made up for a lot of disappointments in Henry's long life. Despite his ever-present anxiety over the Black's soundness, Henry was a happy man. Having a great horse could make anyone really enjoy life to the fullest.</p><h2>Merchants of Virtue (The Huguenot Chronicles)</h2><p>Would you denounce your faith to defend your home and family?

Some of her novels for adults have been successfully reissued for the young adult market in recent years. For the historical novel&nbsp;<i>Journey to the River Sea&nbsp;</i>(Macmillan, 2001), she won the Smarties Prize in category 9&#x2013;11 years, garnered unusual commendation as runner-up for the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, and made the Carnegie Medal, Whitbread Award, and Blue Peter Book Award shortlists. She was a finalist for the 2010 Guardian Children's Fiction Prize at the time of her death. Her last book,&nbsp;<i>The Abominables</i>, was one of eight books on the longlist for the same award in 2012.*Starred Review* Gr. 4-8. Ibbotson's latest is a galloping historical novel set in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Abandoned as an infant, 12-year-old Annika lives in Vienna with the cook and housemaid who discovered her as well as their employers, a sibling trio of eccentric professors. Annika helps with the housework and grows up comfortably in the warm house on a beautiful square, surrounded by friends. Still, Annika dreams of reuniting with the unknown parents who abandoned her, and when an elegant, charismatic woman appears, birth certificate in hand, Annika embraces her as her long-lost mother and agrees to move to the family's remote northern castle. The grand estate isn't what she expected, though, and she fights waves of homesickness as troubling clues begin to emerge about her new family. Ibbotson leads her characters through a delightful, breathless adventure that skillfully enfolds deliciously cruel villains, crumbling aristocratic families, stolen jewels, and a cast of lovable, intrepid professors and children determined to rescue Annika from danger. Viennese-born Ibbotson layers her suspenseful story with exquisite details that contrast the city's cozy clamor with the bone-chilling northern landscape, beautifully echoing Annika's plight.

The heteronyms launch movements and write manifestos, and one of them attempts to break up Pessoa&#39;s only known romantic relationship. Also included is a generous selection from Pessoa&#39;s masterpiece, The Book of Disquiet, freshly translated by Richard Zenith from newly discovered materials.

The miners and gamblers who first visited the state all bet on luck. Today, the biggest contributor to Nevada&#x2019;s tourist economy, gaming, still relies on that same belief in luck. Nevada&#x2019;s financial system has generally been based on a &#x201c;one industry&#x201d; economy, first mining and, more recently, gaming. Green delves deeply into the limitations of this structure, while also exploring the theme of exploitation of the land and the overuse of the state&#x2019;s natural resources. Green covers many more aspects of the Silver State&#x2019;s narrative, including the dominance of one region of the state over another, political forces and corruption, and the citizens&#x2019; often tumultuous relationship with the federal government. The book will appeal to scholars, students, and other readers interested in Nevada history.</p><p>Michael S.

Each time he said it, I imagined all of us in a fishbowl, our hands sliding frantically along the glass sides as water crept above our necks, our noses, our eyes.</p><p>I fall asleep listening to our old records and wake with my mouth dry, my tongue as rough as a cat&#x2019;s. I pull the handle of my La-Z-Boy and, with a jolt, am sitting upright. A pile of photos rests in my lap.</p><p>I own the most famous photograph of Sofia Salvador&#x2014;the Brazilian Bombshell, the Fruity Cutie Girl, the fast-talking, eye-popping nymph with her glittering costumes and pixie-cut hair who, depending on your age and nationality, is either a joke, an icon of camp, a victim, a traitor, a great innovator, or even, as one researcher anointed her, &#x201c;an object of serious study of Hollywood&#x2019;s Latinas.&#x201d; (Is that what they&#x2019;re calling us now?) I bought the original photo and its negative at auction, paying much more than they were worth. Money isn&#x2019;t an issue for me these days; I&#x2019;m filthy rich and am not ashamed to say so. When I was young, musicians had to pretend that success and money didn&#x2019;t matter. Ambition, in a sambista and especially in a woman, was seen as an unforgivable fault.</p><p>In the photo, taken in 1942, Sofia Salvador wears the pixie cut she made famous. Her eyes are wide. Her lips are parted. Her tongue flicks the roof of her mouth; it is unclear if she is singing or screaming. Earrings made to resemble life-sized hummingbirds&#x2014;their jeweled eyes glinting, their golden beaks sharp&#x2014;dangle from her ears. She was vain about her lobes, worried they would sag under the weight of her array of earrings, each one more fantastical than the next. She was vain about everything, really; she had to be.</p><p>In the photograph she wears a gold choker, wrapped twice around her neck. Below it are strand upon strand of fake pearls, each one as large as an eyeball. Then there are the bracelets&#x2014;bands of coral and gold&#x2014;taking up most of her forearms. At the end of each day, when I&#x2019;d take those necklaces and bracelets off her and she stopped being Sofia Salvador (for a moment, at least), Gra�a flapped her arms and said, &#x201c;I feel so light. I could fly away!&#x201d;</p><p>Gra�a drew Sofia&#x2019;s dark eyebrows arched so high she always looked surprised. The mouth&#x2014;that famous red mouth&#x2014;was what took her the longest to produce. She lined beyond her lips so that, like everything else, it was an exaggeration of the real thing. Who was the real thing? By the end of her short life, even Gra�a had trouble answering this question.</p><p>The picture was taken for <i>Life</i> magazine. The photographer stood Gra�a against a white backdrop. &#x201c;Pretend you&#x2019;re singing,&#x201d; he ordered. &#x201c;Why pretend?&#x201d; Gra�a replied.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought that&#x2019;s all you knew how to do,&#x201d; the photographer shot back. He was famous and believed his fame gave him the right to be nasty.</p><p>Gra�a stared. She was very tired. We always were, even me, who signed Sofia Salvador&#x2019;s name to hundreds of glossy photos while Gra�a and the Blue Moon boys endured eighteen-hour days of filming, costume fittings, screen tests, dance rehearsals, and publicity shoots for whatever her latest movie musical was. It could have been worse; we could have been starving like in the old days. But at least in the old days we played real music, together.</p><p>&#x201c;Then I will pretend to respect you,&#x201d; Gra�a said to that fool photographer. Then she opened her mouth and sang. People remember the haircut, the enormous earrings, the sequined skirts, the accent, but they forget her voice. When she sang for that photographer, his camera nearly fell from his hands.</p><p>I listen to her records&#x2014;only our early recordings, when she sang Vinicius&#x2019;s and my songs&#x2014;and it is as if she is still seventeen and sitting beside me. Gra�a, with all of her willfulness, her humor, her petty resistances, her pluck, her complete selfishness. This is how I want her, if only for the span of a three-minute song.</p><p>When the song ends, I&#x2019;m exhausted and whimpering. I imagine her here, nudging me, bringing me back to my senses.</p><p><i>Why the hell are you upset, Dor?</i> Gra�a chides. <i>At least you&#x2019;re still around</i>.</p><p>Her voice is so clear, I have to remind myself she isn&#x2019;t real. I have known Gra�a longer in my imagination than in real life.</p><p><i>Who wants real life?</i> Gra�a asks, laughing at me. (She is always laughing at someone.)</p><p>I shake my head. After all this time&#x2014;ninety-five years, to be exact&#x2014; I still do not know the answer.</p><p>My current life is a dull jumble of walks along the beach chaperoned by a nurse; trips to the grocery store; afternoons in my office; evenings listening to records; tedious hours spent tolerating a steady stream of physical therapists and doctors with their proclamations and humorless devotion. I live in a vast house surrounded by paid help. Once, long ago, I wished for such ease.</p><p><i>Be careful what you wish for</i>, Dor.</p><p>It&#x2019;s too late to be careful now, amor.</p><p>Now, I wish for the early, chaotic part of my life&#x2014;those first thirty or so years&#x2014;to return to me, even with its cruelty, its sacrifice, its missteps, its misdeeds. My misdeeds. If I could hear my life&#x2014;if I could put it on a turntable like a worn-out LP&#x2014;I&#x2019;d hear samba. Not the boisterous kind they play during Carnaval. Not one of those silly marchinhas, as short-lived and vapid as bubbles. And not the soft-spoken, romantic sort, either. No. Mine would be the kind of samba you&#x2019;d find in a roda: the kind we played in a circle after work and a few stiff drinks. It begins quite dire-sounding, perhaps with the lonely moan of a cu�ca. Then, ever so slowly, others join the roda&#x2014;voices, guitars, a tamborim drum, the scratch of a reco-reco&#x2014;and the song begins to claw its way out of its lowly beginning and into something fuller, thicker, darker. It has all of the elements of a true samba (though not necessarily a great one). There is lament, humor, rebelliousness, lust, ambition, regret. And love. There is that, too. It is all improvisation, so if there are mistakes I must move past them and keep playing. Beneath it all, there is the ostinato&#x2014;the main groove that never varies, never wavers. It keeps its stubborn pace; the beat that&#x2019;s always there. And here I am: the only one left in the circle, conjuring voices I have not heard in decades, listening to a chorus of arguments I should never have made. I have tried not to hear this song in full. I have tried to blot it out with drink and time and indifference. But it remains in my head, and will not stop until I recall all of its words. Until I sing it out loud, from beginning to end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE SWEET RIVER</p><p>Share this bottle with me,</p><p>share this song.</p><p>The years have hardened my heart.</p><p>Drink will loosen my tongue.</p><p>Come, walk with me,</p><p>to the places I once loved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Man made the fire</p><p>to burn the fields of cane.</p><p>God made music</p><p>to take away my pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I come from a land</p><p>where sugar is king and the river is sweet.</p><p>They say a woman drowned there,</p><p>her ghost haunts the deep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sit beside me now, at the riverbank</p><p>hear my voice, loud and strong.</p><p>Wade into these sweet waters with me,</p><p>let me open your heart with a song.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now we&#x2019;re both pulled under, friend,</p><p>singing the same refrain:</p><p>Dive back, again, to the place you once loved</p><p>and you&#x2019;ll find it&#x2019;s never the same.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Man made the fire</p><p>to burn the fields of cane. God made music</p><p>to take away my pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>THE SWEET RIVER</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It would be better to begin with Gra�a&#x2014;with her arrival, with our first meeting. But life isn&#x2019;t as orderly as a story or a song; it does not always begin and end at compelling points. Even before Gra�a&#x2019;s arrival, even as a small child, I sensed that I&#x2019;d been born into a role that didn&#x2019;t fit my ambitions, like a stalk of sugarcane crammed into a thimble.</p><p>I survived my own birth, a true feat in 1920 if you were born to a dirt-poor mother living on a sugar plantation. The midwife who delivered me told everyone how surprised she was that such a hearty girl could&#x2019;ve come from my mother&#x2019;s tired womb. I was her fifth and final child. Most women who worked on the plantation had ten or twelve or even eighteen children, so my mother&#x2019;s womb was fresher and younger than most. But she was not married and never had been. All of my long-lost brothers and myself&#x2014;I was the only girl in our lot&#x2014;had different fathers. This made my mother worse than a puta in many people&#x2019;s minds, because at least a puta had the sense to charge for her services.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t dare ask about my mother, afraid of what I might hear and not willing to risk a beating; I was not allowed to ask any questions at all, you see. No one spoke of her, except to insult me. They said I was big-boned, like her. They said I had a temper, like her. They said I was ugly as sin, like her, except I did not have scars covering my arms and face from the cane. She was, for a little while at least, a sugarcane cutter&#x2014;one of a handful of women who could stomach the work. But the insult that came up the most was the one about her easy way with men. If I didn&#x2019;t use enough salt to scrub blood from the plantation&#x2019;s cutting boards, or if I stopped stirring the infernally hot jam on the stove for even a second, or if I was too slow bringing Cook Nena or her staff ingredients from the pantry or garden, I was smacked with a wooden spoon and called &#x201c;puta&#x2019;s girl.&#x201d; So I came to know my mother through all of the things people despised about her, and about me. And I realized, though I could not articulate it clearly as a child, that people hated what they feared, and so I was proud of her.</p><p>The midwife took pity on me, being such a healthy baby, and instead of smothering me, or throwing me in the cane for the vultures pick at, or giving me to some plantation owner to raise like a pet or a slave (all common practices back then for girl children without families), she gave me to Nena, the head cook on the Riacho Doce plantation. There were hundreds of cane plantations along the coast of our state of Pernambuco, and Riacho Doce was one of the largest. In good times, when sugar prices were high, Cook Nena led a staff of ten kitchen maids and two houseboys. Nena was as full-breasted as a prize rooster and had hands as large and as lethal as her cast-iron frying pans. The Pimentel family owned Riacho Doce and were the masters of its Great House, but Nena ruled in the kitchen. This is why no one objected when, after the midwife brought me, naked and wailing, to Nena, the cook decided to raise me as her kitchen girl.</p><p>Everyone in the Great House&#x2014;maids, laundresses, stable boys, houseboys&#x2014;went to Nena&#x2019;s kitchen to get a look at me. They freely remarked on my rosy skin, my long legs, my perfect feet. A day later, I stopped drinking the goat&#x2019;s milk Nena gave me in a bottle. Nena visited a local wet nurse and I spat the woman&#x2019;s teats from my mouth. I was too young to eat manioc porridge but Nena tried to feed it to me anyway. I spat that out, too, and soon turned shriveled and yellow-skinned like an old crone. People said I&#x2019;d been cursed by the evil eye. Olho mau, they called it, olho gordo. Both are different names for the same bad luck.</p><p>Nena went to Old Euclides for help. Euclides was wrinkled, gossipy, and the color of blackstrap scraped from the sugar mill&#x2019;s vats. He&#x2019;d worked at R iacho Doce longer than Nena had, first as a stable boy and then as its groundskeeper. He had a donkey who&#x2019;d given birth and lost her foal but not her milk. Nena took me to the stables and held me straight to that jega&#x2019;s teat, and I drank. I drank that jega&#x2019;s milk until I was fat and strong again. My color changed; I was less like a rose and more like that donkey&#x2019;s tan coat. My hair grew in thick. After that, I was called Jega.</p><p>In people&#x2019;s superstitious and backward minds, the girl I became was inextricably linked to the mother&#x2019;s milk I&#x2019;d drunk.</p><p>&#x201c;Jega&#x2019;s as dumb as an ass,&#x201d; the houseboys teased.</p><p>&#x201c;Jega&#x2019;s as stubborn as an ass,&#x201d; the kitchen maids complained.</p><p>&#x201c;Jega&#x2019;s as ugly as an ass,&#x201d; the stable boys said when they felt spiteful.</p><p>They all wanted me to believe it. They wanted me to become that Jega. I would never give them that satisfaction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Great House sat on a hill. You could stand on its pillared front porch and see nearly all of Riacho Doce&#x2019;s workings: the main gate, the mill with its blackened smokestack, the horse and donkey stables, the administrator&#x2019;s house, the carpenter&#x2019;s shed, the old manioc mill, a small square of pasture and corn, the distillery and warehouses with their thick iron doors. And you could see the brown line of water that gave Riacho Doce its name, although it was much wider than a creek and its waters were not sweet.</p><p>Every plantation had a ghost story and ours was no different: a woman had drowned in the creek and lived there still. Some said she was killed by a lover, others said a master, others said she killed herself. They said you could hear her at night, under the waters, singing for her lost love or trying to lure people into the waters and drown them to keep her company; the story depended on whether you believed in the kind ghost or the vengeful one. R iacho Doce&#x2019;s mothers told their chil- dren this before bed, and it kept them away from the river. I heard the ghost&#x2019;s story from Nena.</p><p>Behind the Great House was an orchard, and behind that the low- roofed slaves&#x2019; senzalas that had been converted into servants&#x2019; quarters. Nena and I were the only staff allowed to sleep in the Great House it- self, which set us apart from the rest of the servants. This special status didn&#x2019;t affect Nena as much as it did me. I was Jega&#x2014;the lowest soul in the strict hierarchy of the Great House&#x2014;and the maids and houseboys were determined to remind me of this fact. They slapped me, pinched my neck, cursed and spat at me. They thwacked me with wooden spoons and greased the staff doorway with lard to make me slip and fall. They locked me in the foul-smelling outhouse until I kicked my way out. Nena knew about these pranks but didn&#x2019;t stop them.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the way a kitchen is,&#x201d; Nena said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky the boys aren&#x2019;t trying to get under your skirts. They will soon enough. Better learn to fight them now.&#x201d;</p><p>Nena always issued such warnings to me:</p><p><i>Better keep your head down. </i></p><p><i>Better stay out of sight. </i></p><p><i>Better make yourself useful.</i></p><p>If I failed to heed her warnings she beat me with a wooden spoon, or an old bullwhip, or with her bare hands. And while I feared these beatings I didn&#x2019;t think them odd or bad; I knew no other kind of affection, and neither did Nena. She used her fists to teach me things she couldn&#x2019;t articulate, lessons that would keep me alive. Nena could keep me safe in her kitchen but nowhere else. I was a creature without family or money. I was another mouth to feed. And, even worse, I was a girl. At the owners&#x2019; whim, I could be thrown out of the Great House and left to fend for myself in that sea of sugarcane. And what did an ugly little girl have to offer the world but he...</p></p><h2>Have You Seen Her?</h2><p>Widowed special agent Stephen Thatcher meets his teenage son&#39;s teacher, Jenna Marshall.

When they meet, their own chemistry takes over and they find themselves falling in love, despite their troubled romantic pasts and the fact that Jenna may be next on the killer's list. Rose populates her novel with vivid characters - like Steven's seven-year-old son Nicky, who was a character in Rose's previous novel - and stokes the tension to a fever pitch, throwing in shocking twists each time the story threatens to settle into predictability. Though some of Steven and Jenna's lovers' quarrels deteriorate into melodrama, readers will hardly notice as they rush to the novel's thrilling conclusion.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His interested included education, macro-economics, geo-politics, mythology, history, mystery novels and music. He wrote his first interactive book, Journey Under the Sea, in 1976 and published it under the series name The Adventures of You. A few years later Bantam Books bought this book and gave Montgomery a contract for five more, to inaugurate their new children s publishing division. Bantam renamed the series Choose Your Own Adventure and a publishing phenomenon was born. The series has sold more than 260 million copies in over 40 languages. He was married to the writer Shannon Gilligan.

When he arrives at Clonliffe Seminary in the 1970s, it is a time in Ireland when priests are highly respected, and Odran believes that he is pledging his life to "the good."</p><p>Forty years later, Odran's devotion is caught in revelations that shatter the Irish people's faith in the Catholic Church. He sees his friends stand trial, colleagues jailed, the lives of young parishioners destroyed, and grows nervous of venturing out in public for fear of disapproving stares and insults. At one point, he is even arrested when he takes the hand of a young boy and leads him out of a department store looking for the boy's mother.</p><p>But when a family event opens wounds from his past, he is forced to confront the demons that have raged within the church, and to recognize his own complicity in their propagation, within both the institution and his own family.</p><p>A novel as intimate as it is universal, <i>A History of Loneliness</i> is about the stories we tell ourselves to make peace with our lives. It confirms Boyne as one of the most searching storytellers of his generation.</p></p><p><b>John Boyne</b> is the author of <i>Crippen, The Thief of Time, Next of Kin</i>, and the <i>New York Times</i>and internationally bestselling <i>The Boy in the Striped Pajamas</i>. Boyne won two Irish Book Awards (the People&#x2019;s Choice and the Children&#x2019;s) for <i>The Boy in the Striped Pajamas</i>, which was made into a Miramax feature film, and his novels have been translated into more than thirty languages. Ireland's <i>Sunday Business Post</i> named him one of the forty people under forty in Ireland "likely to be the movers and shakers who will define the country's culture, politics, style and economics in 2005 and beyond." Crippen was nominated for the <i>Sunday Independent</i> Hughes &amp; Hughes Irish Novel of the Year Award. He lives with his partner in Dublin.<p>&#x201c;The complex architecture of this haunting novel is seamlessly constructed. The path to the priesthood that Odran Yates follows is both understandable and sympathetic. And Father Yates is a good man; he is innocent of the false accusations made against him (he's <i>not </i>a pedophile). John Boyne has created a character who holds himself accountable for the sins of others. No writer today handles guilt with as much depth and sadness. As Father Yates takes himself to task for all he <i>didn't </i>do, nothing less than the sexual duplicity and cover-ups of the Catholic Church are indicted. This is John Boyne's most important novel and of vital importance to Irish history; it is also a gripping story, one no reader can put down until its devastating end.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John Irving</i></p><p>&#x201c;John Boyne brings a completely fresh eye to the most important stories. He is one of the great craftsmen in contemporary literature.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Colum McCann</i></p><p>&#x201c;John Boyne has plunged into the dark and troubled history of the Catholic Church in our time and come up with a novel to treasure. Unflinching, moving, and true.&#x201d; &#x2015;John Banville, author of <i>Ancient Light</i></p><p>&#x201c;An urgently compelling story of power, corruption, lies, self-deceits, and the damage that happens when we turn our eyes from wrong. Anyone who wants to know what happened in the Irish Catholic Church needs to read this brave, righteously angry, and stunning book. Some of us have long wondered what it would be like if a master storyteller turned his powers to this theme. Now we know.&#x201d; &#x2015;Joseph O'Connor, author of<i> Star of the Sea</i></p><p>&#x201c;Boyne's plotting and pacing are first-rate, and his mastery of the slow-boil is evident.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Daily Beast</i></p><p>&#x201c;With this exceptional piece of fiction, Boyne has explored a subject with insight and sensitivity which most would shy away from. It's a brave, angry and powerful novel which sheds new light on a dark chapter in Ireland's history.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Daily Mail UK</i></p></p><h2>What She Wants (Life in Icicle Falls, 3)</h2><p><br><br><em>What </em>do<em> women want?</em><br><br>Jonathan Templar and his poker buddies can't figure it out. Take Jonathan, for instance. He's been in love with Lissa Castle since they were kids but, geek that he is, she's never seen him as her Mr. Perfect. He has one last shot&#x2014;their high school reunion. Kyle Long is equally discouraged. The pretty receptionist at his office keeps passing him over for other guys who may be taller but are definitely <em>not</em> superior. And Adam Edwards might be the most successful of Jonathan's friends, but he isn't having any success on the home front. His wife's kicked him out.<br><br>When Jonathan stumbles on a romance novel at the Icicle Falls library sale, he knows he's found the love expert he's been seeking&#x2014;Vanessa Valentine, top-selling romance author. At first his buddies laugh at him for reading romance novels, but soon they, too, realize that these stories are the world's best textbooks on love. Poker night becomes book club night...and when all is read and done, they're going to be the kind of men women want!<br><br></p><p>Sheila Roberts lives on a lake in the Pacific Northwest. Her novels have been published in several languages. Her book, <em>Angel Lane</em>, was an Amazon Top Ten Romance pick for 2009. Her holiday perennial, <em>On Strike for Christmas</em>, was made into a movie for the Lifetime Movie Network and her novel, <em>The Nine Lives of Christmas</em>, was made into a movie for Hallmark . You can visit Sheila on Twitter and Facebook or at her website (http://www.sheilasplace.com).<br><br>Working in such close quarters with a woman that you could bump knees (thighs, and maybe even other body parts) was probably every man's dream job. Except Dot Morrison's knees were knobby and she was old enough to be Jonathan Templar's grandmother. And she looked like Maxine of greeting card fame. So there was no knee (or anything else) bumping going on today.<br><br>"Okay, you're good to go," he said, pushing back from the computer in the office at Breakfast Haus, Dot's restaurant. "But remember what I told you. If you want your computer to run more efficiently, you've got to slick your hard drive once in a while."<br><br>"There you go talking dirty to me again," Dot cracked.<br><br>A sizzle sneaked onto Jonathan's cheeks, partly because old ladies didn't say things like that (Jonathan's grandma sure didn't), and partly because he'd never talked dirty to a woman in his life. Well, not unless you counted a <em>Playboy</em> centerfold. When talking with most real-life women, his tongue had a tendency to tie itself into more knots than a bag of pretzels, especially when a woman was good-looking. This, he told himself, was one reason he was still single at the ripe old age of thirty-three. That and the fact that he wasn't exactly the stuff a woman's dreams were made of. It was a rare woman who dreamed of a skinny, bespectacled guy in a button-down shirt. Those weren't the only reasons, though. Carrying a torch for someone tended to interfere with a guy's love life.<br><br>Never certain how to respond to Dot's whacked-out sense of humor, he merely smiled, shook his head and packed up his briefcase.<br><br>"Seriously," she said, "I'm glad this didn't turn out to be anything really bad. But if it had, I know I could count on you. You can't ever leave Icicle Falls. What would us old bats do when we have computer problems?"<br><br>"You'd manage," Jonathan assured her.<br><br>"I doubt it. Computers are instruments of torture to anyone over the age of sixty."<br><br>"No worries," he said. "I'm not planning on going anywhere."<br><br>"Until you meet Ms. Right. Then you'll be gone like a shot." The look she gave him was virtually a guarantee that something was about to come out of her mouth that would make him squirm. Sure enough. "We'll have to find you a local girl."<br><br>Just what he needed&#x2014;Dot Morrison putting the word out that Jonathan Templar, computer nerd, was in the market for a local girl. He didn't want a local girl. He wanted...<br><br>"Tilda's still available."<br><br>Tilda Morrison, supercop? She could easily bench-press Jonathan. "Uh, thanks for the offer, but I think she needs someone tougher."<br><br>"There's a problem. Nobody's as tough as Tilda. Damn, I raised that girl wrong. At this rate I'm never going to get grandchildren." Dot shrugged and reached for a cigarette. "Just as well, I suppose. I'd have to spend all my free hours baking cookies for the little rodents."<br><br>Sometimes it was hard to know whether or not Dot was serious, but this time Jonathan was sure she didn't mean what she'd said. She was only trying to make the best of motherly frustration. Dot wanted grandkids. Anyone who'd seen her interacting with the families who came into the restaurant could tell that. It was a wonder she made any money with all the free hot chocolate she slipped her younger patrons.<br><br>She lit up and took a deep drag on her cigarette. Her little office was about to get downright smoggy. Washington State law prohibited smoking in public places, but Dot maintained that her office wasn't a public place. Jonathan suspected one of these days she and the local health inspector were going to get into it over the cigarettes she sneaked in this room.<br><br>"I'd better get going," he said, gathering his things and trying not to inhale the secondhand smoke pluming in his direction.<br><br>"You gonna bill me as usual?"<br><br>"Yep."<br><br>"Don't gouge me," she teased.<br><br>"Wouldn't dream of it. And put your glasses on to read your bill this time," he teased back as he walked to the door. He always tried to give Dot a senior's discount and she always overpaid him, claiming she'd misread the bill. Yep, Dot was a great customer.<br><br>Heck, all his customers were great, he thought as he made his way to Sweet Dreams Chocolate Company, where Elena, the secretary, was having a nervous breakdown thanks to a new computer that she swore was possessed.<br><br>The scent of chocolate floating up from the kitchens below greeted him as he entered the office and Elena looked at him as if he were Saint George come to slay a dragon. "Thank God you're here."<br><br>People were always happy to see the owner and sole employee of Geek Gods Computer Services. Once Jonathan arrived on the scene, they knew their troubles would be fixed.<br><br>He liked that, liked feeling useful. So he wasn't a mountain of muscle like Luke Goodman, the production manager at Sweet Dreams, or a mover and shaker like Blake Preston, manager of Cascade Mutual. Some men were born to have starring roles and big, juicy parts on the stage of life. Others were meant to build scenery, pull the curtains, work in the background to make sure everything on stage ran well. Jonathan was a backstage kind of guy. Nothing wrong with that, he told himself. Background workers made it possible for the show to go on.<br><br>But leading ladies never noticed the guy in the background. Jonathan heaved a sigh. Sometimes he felt like Cyrano de Bergerac. Without the nose.<br><br>"This thing is making me loco," Elena said, glaring at the offending piece of technology on her desk.<br><br>The company owner, Samantha Sterling&#x2014;recently married to Blake Preston&#x2014;had just emerged from her office. "More loco than we make you?"<br><br>"More loco than even my mother makes me," Elena replied.<br><br>Samantha gave her shoulder a pat. "Jonathan will fix it."<br><br>Elena grunted. <em>"Equipo del infierno."</em><br><br>"Computer from hell?" Jonathan guessed, remembering some of his high school Spanish.<br><br>Elena's frustrated scowl was all the answer he needed.<br><br>"Don't worry," Samantha told her. "Jonathan will help you battle the forces of technology evil. When Cecily comes in, tell her I'll be back around one-thirty. Try to keep my favorite assistant from tearing her hair out," she said to Jonathan.<br><br>"No worries," he said, then promised Elena, "I'll have this up and running for you in no time."<br><br><em>No time</em> turned out to be about an hour, but since Elena had expected to lose the entire day she was delighted. "You are amazing," she told him just as Sa-mantha's sister Cecily arrived on the scene.<br><br>"Has he saved us again?" she asked Elena, smiling at Jonathan.<br><br>"Yes, as usual."<br><br>Jonathan pushed his glasses back up his nose and tried to look modest. It was hard when people praised him like this.<br><br>But then, as he started to pack up his tools, Cecily said something that left him flat as a stingray. "I heard from Tina Swift that you guys have your fifteen-year reunion coming up."<br><br>"Uh, yeah."<br><br>"Those are so much fun, seeing old friends, people you used to date," she continued.<br><br>This was worse than Dot's cigarette smoke. Chatting with Cecily always made him self-conscious. Chatting with Cecily about his high school reunion would make him a nervous wreck, especially if she began asking about women he used to date. Jonathan hit high speed gathering up his tools and his various discs.<br><br>"Are you going to the reunion?" she asked him.<br><br>"Maybe," he lied, and hoped she'd leave it at that.<br><br>She didn't. "I moved back just in time for my ten-year and I'm glad I went. There were some people I wouldn't have had a chance to see otherwise."<br><br>There were some people Jonathan wanted to do more than see. Some people with long, blond hair and... He snapped his briefcase shut and bolted for the door. "So, Elena, I'll bill you."<br><br>"Okay," she called.<br><br>The door hadn't quite shut behind him when he heard Elena say to Cecily, "He needs confidence, that one."<br><br>It was an embarrassing thing to hear about himself, but true. He needed a lot more than confidence, though. How could a guy be confident when he didn't have anything to be confident <em>about?</em><br><br>By now it was time for lunch, so he grabbed some bratwurst and sauerkraut at Big Brats and settled in at one of the cafe tables in the stone courtyard adjacent to the popular sausage stand. This was a perfect day for outside dining. The sun warmed his back and a mountain breeze worked as a counterbalance to keep him from getting too hot. A cloudless sky provided a blue backdrop for the mountains.<br><br>During weekends the eating area was so crowded you had to take a number. Today, however, it was relatively quiet with only a few tables occupied.<br><br>Ed York, who owned D'Vine Wines, and Pat Wilder, who owned Mountain Escape Books, sauntered across the street to place an order. They stopped by Jonathan's table to say hello but didn't ask him to join them. No surprise. Pat and Ed had a thing going.<br><br>According to Jonathan's mom, Ed had been interested in Pat ever since he moved to Icicle Falls and opened his wine shop. But Pat had been mourning a husband and wasn't remotely interested. It looked like that was changing now. Watching Ed's romantic success kept the small flame of hope alive in Jonathan. Maybe, if a guy hung in there long enough, getting the woman of his dreams could become a reality.<br><br>Or maybe the guy was just wasting his life dreaming. Jonathan crumpled his napkin. Time to get back to work.<br><br>His next client was Gerhardt Geissel, who owned and ran Gerhardt's Gasthaus with his wife, Ingrid.<br><br>Gerhardt was a short, husky, fifty-something man with gray hair and a round, florid face. He loved his wife's German cooking, loved his beer and was proud to celebrate his Tyrolean heritage by wearing lederho-sen when he played the alpenhorn for his guests first thing every morning.<br><br>He played it even when he didn't have guests. Recently he'd gotten carried away celebrating his birthday and had decided to serenade his dinner guests after having one too many beers and had fallen off the ledge of the balcony outside the dining room. He'd fallen about twelve feet but fortunately had broken his arm instead of his back.<br><br>"Jonathan, <em>wie geht's?</em>" he greeted Jonathan, raising his castencased arm as Ingrid showed Jonathan into his office. "I hope you are here to solve all my problems."<br><br>"That is an impossible task," said his wife.<br><br>Gerhardt made a face. "See how she loves me."<br><br>His wife made a face right back at him and left. But she returned a few minutes later with a piece of Black Forest cake for Jonathan. "You're too skinny," she informed him. "You need to eat more."<br><br>"You need a wife to cook for you," her husband added.<br><br>"My youngest niece, Mary, lives just over in Wenatchee, and she's very pretty," Ingrid said.<br><br>"And very stupid." Gerhardt shook his head in disgust. "Jonathan's smart. He needs a smart woman."<br><br>"Mary is smart," Ingrid insisted. "She just makes bad choices."<br><br>"Well, uh, thanks," Jonathan said. "I appreciate the offer." Sometimes he wondered if everyone in Icicle Falls over the age of fifty wanted to match him up.<br><br>Heck, it wasn't only the older people. Even his sister had been known to take a hand, trying to introduce him to the latest someone she'd met and was sure would be perfect for him. Of course, those someones never were.<br><br>Gerhardt's computer problem was simple enough. Jonathan reloaded his operating system and he was done.<br><br>"You'd better get out of here before my wife comes back with Mary's phone number," Gerhardt advised after he'd written Jonathan a check.<br><br>Good idea. Jonathan left by the side door.<br><br>After leaving Gerhardt, he fit in two more clients and then headed home.<br><br>May's late-afternoon sun beamed its blessing on his three-bedroom log house at the end of Mountain View Road as he drove up. He'd originally planned for two bedrooms, but his folks had talked him into the extra one. "You have to have room for a wife and children," his mother had said. Good old Mom, always hopeful.<br><br>Fir and pine trees gave the house its rustic setting, while the pansies and begonias his mother and sister had put in the window boxes and the patch of lawn edged with more flowers added a homey touch. Someone pulling up in front might even think a woman lived there. They'd be wrong. The only female in this house had four legs.<br><br>But Jonathan often pictured the house with a wife and kids in it&#x2014;the wife (a pretty blonde, naturally) cooking dinner while he and the kids played video games. He could see himself as an old man, sitting on the porch, playing chess with a grandson on the set he'd carved himself. The house would've, naturally, passed on to his own son, keeping the property in the family.<br><br>His grandpa had purchased this land as an investment when it was nothing more than a mountain meadow. Gramps could have made a tidy profit selling it, but instead he'd let Jonathan have it for a song when Jonathan turned twenty-five.<br><br>He'd started building his house when he was twenty-seven. A cousin who worked in construction in nearby Yakima had come over and helped him and Dad. Dad hadn't lived to see it finished. He'd had a heart attack just before the roof went on, leaving Jonathan on his own to finish both his house and his life.<br><br>Jonathan had become the man of the family, in charge of helping his mom, his grandmother and his sister cope. He'd been no help to his widowed grandmother, who had tried to outrun her loss by moving to Arizona. He hadn't been much help to his mom, either, beyond setting her up with a computer program so she could manage her finances. He'd tried to help Julia cope but he'd barely been able to cope himself. He should never have let Dad do all that hard physical work.<br><br>"Don't be silly," his mother always said. "Your father could just as easily have died on the golf course. He was doing what he wanted to do, helping you."<br><br></p><h2>Have Yourself a Hairy Little Christmas</h2><p><p>Santa wants a new hairstyle for Christmas, so Elf offers to help!

In this inspirational journey toward finding the healing nature of ecstasy, Anand explains how the two types of ecstatic experiences&#x2014;the moments of epiphany called Ecstatic Awakenings, and Everyday Ecstasy, or the Ecstasy of Flow, a connection to our power and inner wisdom&#x2014;can help us move beyond pain and doubt to reach our highest potential.<br><br>Based on the spiritual path of Tantra, Anand shows how to use the natural energy system of our bodies--the seven chakras&#x2014;as a map to ecstasy. As she guides us through the chakras, she explains how each one plays an important role in transforming energy into erotic passion, healing, empowerment, compassion, creativity, insight, and gratitude. Blocked chakras manifest themselves in surprising ways; wholeness can be achieved&nbsp;&nbsp;only when all of the chakras are open with energy flowing freely. By transforming negative behavioral patterns into positive ones and strengthening ourselves physically, emotionally, and spiritually, we can improve our health, sex life, career, relationships, and find profound meaning in everyday moments.<br><br>With personal anecdotes, exercises, meditations, and rituals, <i>The Art of Everyday Ecstasy</i> shows us how to bring ecstatic energy into the body, mind, heart, and spirit&#x2014;"to embrace every moment in our totality, to respond bodily, feel from the heart, perceive with clarity, and be fully present to others and to life."</p><p><b>Margot Anand&nbsp;</b>is an internationally acclaimed authority on Tantra, bestselling author, and much-beloved teacher and founder of SkyDancing Tantra. Margot&#x2019;s books, videos, CDs, and DVDs are widely regarded as the seminal teachings for integrating spirituality and sexuality and for cultivating the art of ecstatic living. Her popular books are available in numerous languages and include&nbsp;<i>The Art of Sexual Ecstasy</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Art of Sexual Magic</i>.<b>Seven Tantric Keys of Awakening</b><br><br>The practices and rituals you will find here are doorways that reveal the inherent beauty and meaning of our ordinary moments.<br><br>Say yes to life in all its erotic passion.<br>Go with the flow of the life force within and all around you.<br>Trust yourself, and allow your personal power to manifest in life.<br>Open your heart in loving compassion to the self and others.<br>Authentically express your creativity and your truth.<br>Look within to achieve clarity and insight in your life.<br>Surrender to your Source and know gratitude, spiritual peace, and a new capacity to live at your maximum potential in every moment.<br><br>These seven Tantric keys can open us up to our essential selves and unleash in us that abundant, joyous energy--EveryDay Ecstasy--that allows us to be all that we can be as human beings with our partners and our children and in our work, our community, and the world. In the process, we discover the meaning of <i>elegance,</i> the art of achieving maximum results with minimum effort. Elegant people are in love with life. And their love calls them to make contributions beyond the call of mere duty, to participate fully, to share their joys, pains, gifts, and truths with others. And, by their example, they remind us that beyond our apparent differences, we are connected in Spirit, We are One.<br><br>My own spiritual journey, which led me to the path of EveryDay Ecstasy, began in Paris, when I was eighteen years old. I was wildly in love with my boyfriend; and the first time we made love, at the peak of orgasm, my consciousness expanded until, suddenly, unexpectedly, nothing was left but the absolute certainty that I was utterly and totally free and that this absolute freedom was, for me, the secret of life. This realization set the course of my life.<br><br>This may seem like an unusual beginning to many people. Yet most of us have enjoyed one unforgettable peak moment that leaves us with a yearning for that sense of ecstasy, wholeness, or exquisite peace. Unfortunately, our culture does not teach us the value of such experiences or the skills to cultivate them. But after this first ecstatic moment, I knew I wanted to discover how to integrate spirituality with sexuality in my daily life.<br><br>My studies and degrees in psychology and philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris did not bring any answers to my quest. Later, my practice as a therapist failed to satisfy my hunger for experiential wisdom. I turned to the study of bodywork therapies and self-development groups: bioenergetics, encounter groups, rolfing, Gestalt, Arica, integral yoga. And still I found no direct answers that explained the connection between sexuality and spirituality. I set out on a journey to explore the traditions of sacred sexuality around the world. I soon was introduced to the ancient Eastern science of Tantra; like yoga, Zen, and Sufism, Tantra is a spiritual path to enlightenment. But unlike most mystical paths, Tantra includes sexuality as a doorway to ecstasy and enlightenment. The essence of the Tantric teachings can be summarized as this: Choose with awareness what gives you joy, and it will lead you to Spirit. A particularly attractive approach, I thought, for us Westerners so deeply influenced by the puritanical Judeo-Christian tradition, which conceives of pleasure not as a door to heaven but rather as a shortcut to hell!<br><br>Although this book is not about sexuality, as my other books have been, the Tantric perspective has greatly influenced my work.<br><b>What Is Tantra?</b><br><br>Many people today mistakenly believe that Tantra is a spiritual bastardization of sexual therapy, an excuse to indulge in sensual games, an addiction to hours of sexual orgasms. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The Tantric path teaches us to embrace and unify the ordinary, the erotic, and the sacred dimensions of life, which all have their roots in Spirit.<br><br>The beauty and wisdom of Tantra is that it embraces sexuality as a doorway to the "ecstatic mind of great bliss."&nbsp;&nbsp;Truly, at the peak of orgasm, we pierce through the illusion of fragmentation and separation, and glimpse the unity and interconnectedness of all beings. And through the other--our partner--we fall in love with life.<br><br>Because sex holds this great potential for opening our being to the experience of ecstasy, Tantra has for millennia taught the cultivation of sexual love as an art, as a skillful spiritual practice. Then, as now, Tantra challenges the belief promoted by most spiritual and religious paths that we must suppress or transcend our sexuality to practice meditation or awaken our Spirit. Tantra arose in rebellion against these ascetical and life-negating creeds. It acknowledges that sex is at the root of life and that to make human sexuality and erotic union a form of worship and meditation is to practice reverence for life, leading us directly through the pleasure of the senses to spiritual liberation.<br><br>Tantra teaches that we master desires not by avoiding them but by immersing ourself in them. Once known and experienced deeply, they can be transcended. In fact, Tantra teaches that <i>nothing</i> is to be excluded from our understanding of reality. We need not suffer by sacrificing pleasures. We can cultivate them as opportunities for awakening. Tantra teaches us to embrace every moment in our totality, to respond bodily, feel from the heart, perceive with clarity, and be fully present to others and to life. In this book, we will explore ways to bring such energy, passion, and awareness to all our seemingly ordinary, and extraordinary, moments and to make our everyday life a journey of awakening.<br><br><i>Tantra</i> is a Sanskrit word derived from the root <i>tan,</i> "to expand."&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of my study and practice of the Tantric arts, I developed this definition: Tantra is the art of weaving the often contradictory aspects of our self or personality into a unified whole, for the purpose of expanding our consciousness. Scholar Ajit Mookerjee defines Tantra as "knowledge of a systematic, scientific, and experimental method which offers the possibility of expanding man's consciousness and faculties, a process through which the individual's inherent spiritual powers can be realized."<br><b>Create an Ecstatic Life</b><br><br>What if you began each day from a state of creative awareness, with a clear vision of what you want and how it can be achieved?&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when you want to create a perfect dinner party for good friends, you begin with a vision of a warm gathering filled with intimate friendship, laughter, and good food. You begin, first imaginatively, then actually, to feel and create the atmosphere--you choose a menu, the lighting, the dishes you will use, the music or games you will play. You feel the enjoyment of the evening itself as you prepare for it and anticipate it throughout the day. Below is a ritual for starting your day with clarity, by opening all your centers.<br><br><b>A Ritual for Beginning the Day</b><br><br>Purpose<br><br>To remind yourself that each day represents a brand new opportunity to taste the sacredness of life; a chance to be nurtured by the mystery; a chance to relate lovingly, happily, and even with laughter to everyone around you.<br><br>Preparation<br><br>Have on hand a candle, incense, and matches.<br>Prepare a good sound system with slow, meditative music. (Be sure to pick music that will not interfere with your thoughts and that will not run out before the ritual is completed.)<br>Sit on a comfortable pillow.<br>Wake up fifteen minutes earlier to allow yourself the time to perform this ritual without feeling rushed.<br><br>Practice<br><br>As you wake up, open your eyes slowly, and close them. Then open them again, this time with awareness. Take a few slow, deep breaths and remind yourself that you wanted to get up early this morning to perform this ritual.<br>Get up, put on a robe (make sure you're warm and comfortable), and stretch slowly or shake your body loose from the night's sleep.<br>Light a candle and stick of incense to begin creating your sacred space.<br>Play your music.<br>Sit on your meditation pillow, in a comfortable position. If you are doing this ritual with a partner, sit opposite each other, holding hands.<br>Relax for a few moments, eyes closed, watching the movement of your breath. When you feel calm and quiet, go on to the next step.<br>Begin to focus gently and effortlessly on the day ahead, breathing slowly and deeply. Go through the day, envisioning each moment. See if one difficult challenge presents itself (for instance, you have too much to do today and not enough time to do it, or your child is home sick from school). Look at the thoughts as you would look at a passing landscape through a car window. Let the thoughts come and go.<br>Pay attention to your body. How does your body react to these thoughts?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel any tight spots?&nbsp;&nbsp;A constriction in your chest, stomach cramps, heart palpitations, a simple tensing of the muscles of your jaw and neck?&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoom in on the part of your day's vision that is causing your body pain. This is what you will transform in the ritual. (If you find more than one painful area, take them one at a time. Don't try to do too much at once.)<br>Keep breathing calmly and deeply. Create a mental picture of the difficult moment that you're dreading in your day to come. (We'll use the example of a stressful project at work, one you have to work on with difficult people.) Now release the image, let it travel through your <i>chakras,</i> allowing the energy of each <i>chakra</i> to transform it.<br><br><i>The Root of Creation</i><br><br>Let your awareness dwell in the first <i>chakra,</i> in your genitals. Relax your genital muscles into the earth and allow them to feel vibrant, ready, grounded. Here is where you will generate the vision.<br>See the difficult situation existing inside your first <i>chakra,</i> let it resonate, and begin the transformation.<br>Say (to yourself or out loud), "There is enough time, money, trust, love, understanding to heal this situation."<br>Envision the scene filled with a sense of abundance and resolution. Feel that this is already true, that it has happened. You should not feel pressure to <i>make</i> it happen. When you have this vision firmly in mind, go on to the next <i>chakra.</i><br><br><i>The Flowing Stream</i><br><br>Let your awareness dwell in your navel area. Breathe into your belly and soften the muscles.<br>See the difficult situation existing inside your second <i>chakra,</i> and surround it with a sea of fluidity and flexibility.<br>Say to yourself, "I am open to change."<br>See yourself enjoying the flow of conversation. See everyone finding the place of flexibility in the situation, being open to changing opinions and positions, adapting effortlessly to the currents of energy that your vision carries. When you have an image of the situation transformed by openness and possibility, go on to the next <i>chakra.</i><br><br><i>The Radiant Sun</i><br><br>Let your awareness dwell in your solar plexus. Breathe into your solar plexus, feel it expanding, relaxed, and powerful.<br>See the difficult situation existing inside your third <i>chakra,</i> and infuse it with energy and power.<br>Say to yourself, "I have all the energy I need to complete this project."<br>See yourself and all the people in your image feeling alive and on purpose. You make correct choices, you are innovative and responsible. Your authority is respected. When you have an image of the situation transformed through positive action, go on to the next <i>chakra.</i><br><br><i>The Pulse of Life</i><br><br>Let your awareness dwell in the center of your chest, in your heart area. Open your chest, relaxing the muscles that surround your heart. Feel your heart opening to receive.<br>See the difficult situation existing inside your fourth <i>chakra,</i> and surround the image and everyone in it with love and acceptance.<br>Say to yourself, "I am ready to create a common ground."&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't dwell on successes or failures, or petty antagonism, but simply appreciate what everyone has done so far.<br>Let yourself see how much happier everyone is when they feel acknowledged, how much more motivated they are toward positive results. When you have an image of the situation transformed by love and acceptance, move on to the next <i>chakra.</i><br><br><i>The Song of the Soul</i><br><br>Let your awareness dwell in your throat. Relax your throat, your jaw.<br>See the difficult situation existing inside your fifth <i>chakra,</i> and allow everyone in the vision to express their truth in a creative way.<br>Say to yourself, "I enjoy sharing my creative ideas and hearing others express theirs."<br>See the comical side of the situation. Exaggerate the image if you need to. See everyone dancing a jig around the office, diving off desks, flying paper airplanes over cubicle walls. See thought balloons coming out of their heads, filled with brilliant, witty, outrageous ideas. When your image is transformed by laughter and creative expression, go on to the next <i>chakra.</i><br><br><i>The Full Moon</i><br><br>Let your awareness dwell in your third eye, the area between your eyebrows.<br>Feel the eye opening, taking in the scene with great objectivity. See the difficult situation existing inside your sixth <i>chakra,</i> and envision everyone in the scene feeling connected, integrated between body, mind, and Spirit.<br>Say to yourself, "I act to realize my vision with intention and purpose. I am clear in my action and make the right choices."<br>Now you see the big picture; you are no longer bogged down by details or identifying with criticism. You are witnessing the situation but are not lost in it. You have achieved a balance between understanding the context and listening to your intuitive guidance. Move on to the next <i>chakra.</i><br><br><i>The Open Sky</i><br><br>Let your awareness dwell in the top of your head. Relax the muscles of your scalp and allow this <i>chakra</i> to open, like a cup waiting to be filled. See the newly transformed situation existing as pure potential inside your seventh <i>chakra.</i><br>Say to yourself, "I am ready to receive what I need to heal this situation."<br>See yourself linked with everyone in your image at a soul level. Your Spirits are connecting. You all have a role to play in this situation, and you all know exactly what needs to be done to move the project further. See all of you surrendering your ego needs ("I know better") to your greater purpose: harmony. You become one Spirit. You respect each other. All is well. When you have created this joyous image, let it go out of the top of your head and into the universe, knowing that it has already been accomplished. Move into your day with calm and certainty of success.<br><br><i>Completion</i><br><br>Review your meditation. Have you created a joyous, harmonious day?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel ready to move into your day with ease and confidence?&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're not quite ready, move through the <i>chakras</i> again to heal any remaining block.<br>Take a moment to center yourself. Breathe calmly and deeply for a few more moments, and allow yourself to come back to the present moment.

For more than thirty years, virtually the only people who knew about the Hill Fights were the Marines who fought them. Now, for the first time, the full story<b> </b>has been pieced together by acclaimed Vietnam War historian Edward F. Murphy, whose definitive analysis admirably fills this significant gap in Vietnam War literature. Based on first-hand interviews and documentary research, Murphy&#x2019;s deeply informed narrative history is the only complete account of the battles, their origins, and their aftermath.<br><br>The Marines at the isolated Khe Sanh Combat Base were tasked with monitoring the strategically vital Ho Chi Minh trail as it wound through the jungles in nearby Laos. Dominated by high hills on all sides, the combat base had to be screened on foot by the Marine infantrymen while crack, battle-hardened NVA units roamed at will through the high grass and set up elaborate defenses on steep, sun-baked overlooks.<br><br>Murphy traces the bitter account of the U.S. Marines at Khe Sanh from the outset in 1966, revealing misguided decisions and strategies from above, and capturing the chain of hill battles in stark detail. But the Marines themselves supply the real grist of the story; it is their recollections that vividly re-create the atmosphere of desperation, bravery, and relentless horror that characterized their combat. Often outnumbered and outgunned by a hidden enemy&#x2014;and with buddies lying dead or wounded beside them&#x2014;these brave young Americans fought on.<br><br>The story of the Marines at Khe Sanh in early 1967 is a microcosm of the Corps&#x2019;s entire Vietnam War and goes a long way toward explaining why their casualties in Vietnam exceeded, on a Marine-in-combat basis, even the tremendous losses the Leathernecks sustained during their ferocious Pacific island battles of World War II. <br><br><i>The Hill Fights </i>is a damning indictment of those responsible for the lives of these heroic Marines. Ultimately, the high command failed them, their tactics failed them, and their rifles failed them.<b> </b>Only the Marines themselves did not fail. Under fire, trapped in a hell of sudden death meted out by unseen enemies, they fought impossible odds with awesome courage and uncommon valor.</p><p><b>Edward F.

He lives in Mesa, Arizona.PART ONE<br> &nbsp;<br> In the Beginning<br> &nbsp;<br> Chapter One<br> &nbsp;<br> On a hot, humid day in late September 1966, Lt. Gen. Lewis W. Walt wore a deep scowl across his broad face. The commander of the III Marine Amphibious Force (MAF), which incorporated all Marines in South Vietnam, Walt held strong opinions on how his troops should be used to win the war. When that did not happen, the barrel-chested, volatile head of III MAF got angry. Walt&#x2019;s subordinates at III MAF&#x2019;s headquarters in Da Nang had no doubt the old man was in a foul mood that day. They trembled as he barked into his telephone, snapped orders to his aides, and demanded instant answers to complex questions. Those who served under Walt knew all about his temper. They knew that it did not take much to set him off. Recently, the most frequent catalyst for Walt&#x2019;s fury was his superior, U.S. Army general William C. Westmoreland, the head of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV). Westmoreland had his own plans for using the Marines to fight and win the war in South Vietnam. All too often these clashed with Walt&#x2019;s.<br> &nbsp;<br> The conflict between the Marines and their Army superior had been simmering for more than a year. Although trained since before World War II as a hard-hitting, beach-storming, amphibious force, the Marines took a different approach to the war in South Vietnam. Ever since they landed at Da Nang in March 1965, the Marines had supported pacification efforts as the best way to win this war. Walt fully concurred with the statement made by Marine Corps commandant Gen. Wallace M. Greene, Jr., shortly after the Marines&#x2019; initial landings. &#x201c;The real targets in Vietnam are not the Viet Cong or the North Vietnamese but the South Vietnamese people,&#x201d; Greene had declared.<br> &nbsp;<br> So strongly did Walt believe in this strategy that he approved a number of innovative programs to rid the native villages of their insurgent infrastructure and make the South Vietnamese people feel safe in their homes. But this emphasis on pacification programs did not mean that Walt possessed an unwillingness to engage the enemy in full combat. Indeed, quite the contrary was true. A Marine since graduating from Colorado State University in 1936, Walt was one of the Marine Corps&#x2019; most experienced combat leaders. He commanded a Marine raider company during the D-day landings at Guadalcanal in August 1942 and earned a Silver Star for his heroism. A year later, as a battalion commander, he earned a Navy Cross fighting in the dense jungles of New Britain. He picked up a second one in 1944 battling the Japanese on the fiercely defended coral island of Peleliu. He commanded a Marine regiment during the Korean War, where his aggressiveness and personal valor added more luster to his reputation. If anyone in the Marine Corps knew how to battle with an enemy, it was fifty-three-year-old Lewis William Walt. But he recognized that the civil war in South Vietnam would not be won by the Marines&#x2019; historic method of wresting terrain objectives from the enemy&#x2019;s armies. In his view, if the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army were to be vanquished, it would happen only if the people wanted it to happen. And the only way to get them to want that was to allow them to feel safe in their villages.<br> &nbsp;<br> Walt&#x2019;s strategy had the full backing and enthusiastic support of his immediate Marine Corps superior, Lt. Gen. Victor H. &#x201c;Brute&#x201d; Krulak. As head of the Fleet Marine Force&#x2013; Pacific (FMF-Pac), Krulak provided administrative and logistical support to Walt&#x2019;s Marines, but he had no authority over their operational deployment in South Vietnam; that was General Westmoreland&#x2019;s business. Commissioned in 1934, Krulak served two years in pre&#x2013;World War II China. It was there he began his study of guerrilla warfare and counterinsurgency. As commander of a Marine parachute battalion in World War II, he earned a Navy Cross in October 1942 during the raid on the island of Choiseul. He also saw combat in Korea during that war&#x2019;s later years. Throughout his career he continued his studies of guerrilla warfare. By the 1960s General Krulak not only wielded a tremendous amount of influence as one of the Marine Corps&#x2019; top officers, he was also a recognized expert in counterinsurgency doctrine. In fact, he had served the Joint Chiefs of Staff as special assistant for counterinsurgency and special activities from 1962 to1964.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because 80 percent of South Vietnam&#x2019;s population lived an agrarian existence and raised their own rice crops, both Krulak and Walt recognized that by protecting these peasants and their crops, the insurgents, as well as the infiltrating NVA, would be denied a major food source. The enemy would be forced to depend solely on supplies moved manually from the ports of North Vietnam down the five-hundred-kilometer-long network of paths and roads known collectively as the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Obviously, they could not last long under these circumstances.<br> &nbsp;<br> General Westmoreland, however, had different plans for fighting this war. Although he acknowledged the benefits of pacification, as a West Point graduate (class of 1936), an artillery battery commander in World War II, and a parachute regiment commander in the Korean War, Westmoreland had focused his entire career on conducting conventional warfare. Indeed, he yearned for a major land battle where his superior firepower would decisively defeat the NVA and send them packing back to Hanoi. And the only way to achieve the traditional victory he had trained his whole life for was to send his troops where the enemy was: South Vietnam&#x2019;s rugged, mountainous interior border regions. But with his limited manpower resources, Westmoreland knew he could not protect the people and battle the enemy&#x2019;s main-force units. He had to make a choice. His 1966 battle plan revealed that choice.<br> &nbsp;<br> According to his master plan for conducting the war, American troops, better trained and with greater firepower than the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), would conduct major &#x201c;search-and-destroy&#x201d; operations in the rural, unpopulated areas. Here the combat units could &#x201c;find, fix, and destroy&#x201d; the enemy and his base areas. The ARVN would follow up with &#x201c;clearing operations&#x201d; designed to ferret out any surviving guerrilla forces. Then the local militia units, or Popular Forces, would move in to provide a permanent defense for area villages. As far as Westmoreland was concerned, the Marines&#x2019; preferred strategy for winning the war had been seriously downgraded.<br> &nbsp;<br> But neither General Krulak nor General Walt was easily persuaded. In fact, so strongly did Krulak support the pacification approach that he wrote a seventeen-page appraisal of the situation in South Vietnam and set out to get it reviewed at the highest levels of the U.S. government.<br> &nbsp;<br> Krulak&#x2019;s appraisal concluded with four recommendations:<br> &nbsp;<br> Emphasize the security of the indigent population from guerrilla oppression; fight the enemy&#x2019;s main forces only when the odds are overwhelmingly in our favor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Destroy North Vietnam&#x2019;s rail lines, power plants, and fuel storage centers, and mine the entrance to her seaports.<br> &nbsp;<br> Put all applicable U.S. resources into the pacification process.<br> &nbsp;<br> Force the South Vietnamese government to institute land reform programs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Krulak secured audiences with everyone up to and including Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara and President Lyndon B. Johnson, but his effort failed. His second point, specifically the mining of North Vietnam&#x2019;s harbors, proved anathema to America&#x2019;s foreign policy strategy. President Johnson and Secretary McNamara were completely convinced that this particular action would result in a major global war with the Soviet Union and/or China. Both men lived in fear of such a prospect. Thus, the war in South Vietnam would be fought Westmoreland&#x2019;s way&#x2014;essentially by sending combat troops to fight a war governed by politics rather than by sound military strategy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although assured by McNamara that his strategy would prevail, Westmoreland was politically astute enough to be concerned about accusations of interservice rivalry. Thus, he trod softly when dealing with General Walt. Rather than force the Marines to comply with his strategy for massive infantry campaigns in the hinterlands, Westmoreland preferred to issue orders for specific operations that would eventually pull them out of their coastal enclaves. Opportunities for such orders came sooner rather than later.<br> &nbsp;<br> Evidence of an increased NVA presence in South Vietnam&#x2019;s northern provinces emerged in early 1966. On 28 February, U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers from the isolated outpost at A Shau, located in a wide valley adjacent to the Laotian border ninety kilometers west of Da Nang, captured an NVA soldier. According to the soldier&#x2019;s diary, the 95th Regiment of the NVA 325 Division planned an attack on the camp on the night of 11 March. As a result of this information, reinforcements in the form of indigenous troops were rushed to the camp. Unfortunately, they were of dubious quality and loyalty.<br> &nbsp;<br> The enemy soldier&#x2019;s information proved wrong by two days. His comrades launched their attack in the early morning hours of 9 March. A two-and-a-half-hour mortar barrage blasted the camp from end to end, causing more than fifty casualties among the four hundred defenders. The NVA then hit the camp&#x2019;s southern perimeter with a two-company force. They were repulsed after heavy fighting.<br> &nbsp;<br> The NVA commander had timed his attack well. Low, monsoonal clouds blanketed the valley, limiting retaliatory air strikes and keeping all but a few helicopters out of the A Shau Valley. The NVA continued their attack on the camp throughout 9 March and into the early morning of the tenth. At 0400 that morning the NVA launched their final assaults on the besieged camp. The defenders fought heroically but were badly outnumbered. At 1730 the camp&#x2019;s U.S. Army commander reluctantly ordered it evacuated. A few daring Marine pilots brought their helicopters through the cloud cover and pulled out 69 of the camp&#x2019;s surviving defenders. The remaining defenders fled into the surrounding jungle. In all, 250 of the camp&#x2019;s 400 soldiers were killed or listed as missing. The fall of A Shau opened the way for the NVA to increase its infiltration of men and materiel into South Vietnam&#x2019;s northern provinces.</p><h2>Far North: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>National Book Award Finalist for Fiction</b><br><b></b><br><i>My father had an expression for a thing that turned out bad.

He lives in London.</p><b>Chapter One&nbsp;<br></b>&nbsp; <p></p>Every day I buckle on my guns and go out to patrol this dingy city. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I've been doing it so long that I'm shaped to it, like a hand that's been carrying buckets in the cold. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The winters are the worst, struggling up out of a haunted sleep, fumbling for my boots in the dark. Summer is better. The place feels almost drunk on the endless light and time skids by for a week or two. We don't get much spring or fall to speakof. Up here, for ten months a year, the weather has teeth in it. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>It's always quiet now. The city is emptier than heaven. But before this, there were times so bad I was almost thankful for a clean killing between consenting adults. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Yes, somewhere along the ladder of years I lost the bright-eyed best of me. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Way back, in the days of my youth, there were fat and happy times. The year ran like an orderly clock. We'd plant out from the hothouses as soon as the earth was soft enough to dig. By June we'd be sitting on the stoop podding broad beans until our shoulders ached. Then there were potatoes to dry, cabbages to bring in, meats to cure, mushrooms and berries to gather in the fall. And when the cold closed in on us, I'd go hunting and ice fishing with my pa. We cooked omul and moose meat over driftwood fires at the lake. We rode up the winter roads to buy fur clothes and caribou from the Tungus. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>We had a school. We had a library where Miss Grenadine stamped books and read to us in winter by the wood-burning stove. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I can remember walking home after class across the frying pan in the last mild days before the freeze and the lighted windows sparkling like amber, and ransacking the trees for buttery horse chestnuts, and Charlo's laughter tinkling up through the fog, as my broken branch went thwack! thwack! and the chestnuts pattered around us on the grass. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The old meetinghouse where we worshipped still stands on the far side of the town. We used to sit there in silence, listening to the spit and crackle of the logs. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The last time I went in there was five years ago. I hadn't been inside for years and when I was a child I'd hated every stubborn minute I'd been made to sit there. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>It still smelled like it used to: well-seasoned timber, whitewash, pine needles. But the settles had all been broken up to be burned and the windows were smashed. And in the corner of the room, I felt something go squish under the toe of my boot.It turned out to be someone's fingers. There was no trace of the rest of him. I live in the house I grew up in, with the well in the courtyard and my father's workshop much as it was in my childhood, still taking up the low building next to the side gate. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>In the best room of the house, which was kept special for Sundays, and visitors, and Christmas, stands my mother's pianola,and on it a metronome, and their wedding photograph, and a big gilded wooden M that my father made when I was born. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>As my parents' first child, I bore the brunt of their new religious enthusiasm, hence the name, Makepeace. Charlo was born two years later, and Anna the year after that. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Makepeace. Can you imagine the teasing I put up with at school? And my parents' displeasure when I used my fists to defend myself? <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>But that's how I learned to love fighting. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I still run the pianola now and again, there's a box of rolls that still work, but the tuning's mostly gone. I haven't got a good enough ear to fix it, or a bad enough one not to care that I can't. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>It's almost worth more to me as firewood. Some winters I've looked at it longingly as I sat under a pile of blankets, teeth chattering in my head, snow piled up to the eaves, and thought to myself, Damn it, take a hatchet to it, Makepeace, and be warm again! But it's a point of pride with me that I never have. Where will I get another pianola from? And just because I can't tune the thing and don't know anybody who can, that doesn't mean that person doesn't exist, or won't be born one day. Our generation's not big on reading or tuning pianolas. But our parents and their parents had plenty to be proud of. Just look at that thing if you don't believe me: the burl on the maple veneer, and the workmanship on her brass pedals. The man who made that cared about what he was doing. He made that pianola with love. It's not for me to burn it. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The books all belonged to my folks. Charlo and my ma were the big readers. Except for that bottom shelf. I brought those back here myself. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Usually when I come across books I take them to an old armory on Delancey. It's empty now, but there's so much steel in the outer door, you'd need a keg of gunpowder to get to them without the key. As I said, I don't read them myself, but it's important to put them aside for someone who will. Maybe it's written in one of them how to tune a pianola. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I found them like this: I was going down Mercer Street one morning. It was deep winter. Snow every where, but no wind, and the breath from the mare's nostrils rising up like steam from a kettle. On a windless day, the snow damps the sound, and the silence every where is eerie. Just that crunch of hooves, and those little sighs of breath from the animal. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>All of a sudden, there's a crash, and a big armful of books flops into the snow from what must have been the last unbroken window on the entire street until that moment. The horse reared up at the sound. When I had her calm again, I looked up at the window, and what do you know, there's a little figure hang-dropping into the books. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>He's bundled up in a bulky blue one-piece and fur hat. Now he's gathering up the books and fixing to leave. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I shouted out to him, "Hey. What are you doing? Leave those books, damn it. Can't you find something goddamn else to burn?"--along with a few other choice expressions. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Then, just as quick as he appeared, he flung down his armful of books and reached to draw a gun. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Next thing, there's a pop and the horse rears again and the whole street is more silent than before. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I dismounted, easy does it, with my gun drawn and smoking and go over to the body. I'm still a little high from the draw, but already I'm getting that heavyhearted feeling and I know I won't sleep tonight if he dies. I feel ashamed. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>He's lying still, but breathing very shallow. His hat came off as he fell. It lies in the snow a few steps away from him, among the books. He's much smaller than he seemed a minute earlier. It turns out he's a little Chinese boy. And instead of agun, he was reaching for a dull Bowie knife on his hip that you'd struggle to cut cheese with. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Well done, Makepeace. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>He comes to slightly, grunting with the pain, and tries to push me away from him. "Let me have a look at where you're hit. I can help you. I'm the constable here." But his clothes are too thick for me to examine him, and it's too dangerous to linger here, unarmed and dismounted, especially in daylight. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>It's not going to be comfortable, but the only thing for it is to move him. Better get the books as well, so the whole escapade hasn't been fruitless. I toss them into a burlap sack. The boy weighs nothing. It's heartbreaking. What is he? Fourteen? I lift him onto the saddle and he rides in front of me, drifting in and out of consciousness until we get back. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The good news is he's still breathing. His arms reach feebly for my shoulders as I help him dismount. I know the pain is not so terrible for him yet. The body makes its own opium when it's been hit. But in the middle of that feeling, there's alsoa sensation of injustice. That you've broken something you don't know how to fix, and you won't be the same again. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Once down, the boy refused to let me near him. As much as I tried to explain that I was sorry I'd hurt him and I wanted to help, he'd just slap my hand away. It was clear that we didn't have a common language. There are some tongues where you canget, say, one word in five or ten, and it's enough to make some sense of one another. We had nothing. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>I gave him a pitcher of hot water on a tray, and some long tweezers, and gauze, and carbolic soap, and left him to it. And I locked him in, just to be safe. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The books from the burlap bag I put on the shelves in the living room. They were all odd sizes, so they didn't fit into neat rows like my parents' books. Some of them were picture books. I wondered if the boy was going to read them or burn them. I was pretty sure I knew the answer. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>A burned book always makes my heart sink a little. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Every time I used a bullet, I made myself five more immediately. That had been my rule for a while. My bullets worked out pretty expensive, both in terms of time and the fuel it took to smelt them. It wasn't really economical to make them in suchsmall quantities. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>But wh...</p><h2>Mission Moon 3-D: A New Perspective on the Space Race (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>The story of the lunar landing and the events that led up to it, told in text and visually stunning 3-D images.</b></p><p>July 2019 marks the fiftieth anniversary of Apollo 11's epochal lunar landing, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the surface of the moon.

In a career of over 50 years, spanning the Victorian, Edwardian and modern eras of architecture, Lutyens was prolific. His work ranged from great country houses, city commercial office buildings, his famous World War I memorials across Europe and Britain, and his magnum opus designs for New Delhi built during the 1920s and 1930s. Despite such diversity of building types across his long career, Lutyens's most celebrated works remain his country houses, which first established his reputation during the 1890s. As Lutyens's practice flourished his work became widely promoted in publications such as Country Life magazine, and his houses, particularly those designed in the vernacular manner, would subsequently give rise to an entire genre of the English country house that became known, as it is to this day, as a &#x2018;Lutyens-style' house.<br><br> Sir Edwin Lutyens: The Arts and Crafts Houses brings together in new, wide-format, full-color photography a definitive collection of 45 of Lutyens's great Arts and Crafts houses, in which he ingeniously blended the style of the Arts and Crafts movement with his own inventive interpretation of the Classical language of architecture. The book features 575 all-new current photographs of the houses, inside and outside, together with a selection of floor plans of the houses, and a fresh interpretation of Lutyens's enduring architectural genius.</p><p>DAVID COLE is a practising architect who lives in Melbourne, Australia. <br> <br> Throughout his career as a design director with an Australian-based international architectural practice he has specialised in the design of large-scale commercial and civic projects. In over 30 years of practice he has designed projects throughout Australia, Japan, Thailand, China, United Arab Emirates and New Zealand. <br> <br> David has had a long-term interest in the architecture of the English Arts and Crafts movement.

There, the federal government found unexpected allies among working-class white women devoted to a local tradition of citizen caregiving and seasoned by decades of activism and community service. Jessica Wilkerson tells their stories within the larger drama of efforts to enact change in the 1960s and 1970s. She shows white Appalachian women acting as leaders and soldiers in a grassroots war on poverty--shaping and sustaining programs, engaging in ideological debates, offering fresh visions of democratic participation, and facing personal political struggles. Their insistence that caregiving was valuable labor clashed with entrenched attitudes and rising criticisms of welfare. Their persistence, meanwhile, brought them into unlikely coalitions with black women, disabled miners, and others to fight for causes that ranged from poor people's rights to community health to unionization. Inspiring yet sobering, To Live Here, You Have to Fight reveals Appalachian women as the indomitable caregivers of a region--and overlooked actors in the movements that defined their time.</p></p><p>Jessica Wilkerson is an assistant professor of history and Southern studies at the University of Mississippi."Essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the War on Poverty in Appalachia, this book documents the central role of working class women in Appalachian resistance movements in the 1960s and 1970s. Drawing on a tradition of family care giving and community support, mountain women brought to their activism an awareness of the profound connection between environmental, health, and economic justice that redefined class and gender issues in America and offered an alternative vision for their communities and our capitalist nation. Based upon extensive oral history research, To Live Here, You Have to Fight challenges many of our contemporary assumptions about Appalachia and is an important book for our time."--Ronald D Eller, author of Uneven Ground: Appalachia Since 1945<br><br> "Wilkerson surveys these women and the movements they influenced with thoughtfulness and clarity, forging an intelligent path through complicated chains of historical events." --<i>Knoxville News Sentinel</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br>"A bold new examination of women's struggles in Appalachia rests on a concept that is both simple and profound: the caregiver as activist. . . . Thanks to Wilkerson's efforts, histories of women's bravery and persistence are here brought to life and preserved to inspire new generations." --<i>Women's Review of Books</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "A crucial piece of the history of social justice in America, placing the true history of Appalachian women's radical, blood-red roots on vibrant display." --<i>Kim Kelly, Pacific Standard</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br>"[Wilkerson's] account offers a view of class grounded fundamentally in gender, making it possible to imagine a working-class movement based in sources other than mining minerals and shaping metal&#x2014;the kind of movement now taking shape in Appalachia, which has been the site of a dramatic upswing of working-class protest by women in care jobs over the last year." --<i>Dissent Magazine</i></p><h2>The Prophets of Smoked Meat: A Journey Through Texas Barbecue</h2><p><p>The debut title in the Anthony Bourdain Books line<em>, The Prophets of Smoked Meat</em> by &#x201c;Barbecue Snob&#x201d; Daniel Vaughn, author of the enormously popular blog Full Custom Gospel BBQ, is a rollicking journey through the heart of Texas Barbecue.</p><p>From brisket to ribs, beef to pork, mesquite to oak, this fully illustrated, comprehensive guide to Texas barbecue includes pit masters&#x2019; recipes, tales of the road&#x2014;from country meat markets to roadside stands, sumptuous photography, and a panoramic look at the Lone Star State, where smoked meat is sacred.</p></p><p><p>The comprehensive, must-have guide to Texas barbecue, including pitmasters' recipes, tales of the road&#x2014;from country meat markets to roadside stands&#x2014;and a panoramic look at the Lone Star State, where smoked meat is sacred</p><p>Brisket.

The book shocked and thrilled a world already deep in the throes of the modern age.<br>Today it is revered as a work that, quite literally, helped to shape our world. Le Corbusier articulates concepts and ideas he would put to work in his city planning schemes for Algiers, S�o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Barcelona, Geneva, Stockholm, and Antwerp, as well as schemes for a variety of structures from a museum in Tokyo to the United Nations buildings. The influence it exerted on a new generation of architects is now legendary.<br><i>The City of To-morrow and Its Planning</i> characterizes European cities as a chaos of poor design, inadequate housing, and inefficient transportation that grew out of the unplanned jumble of medieval cities. Developing his thesis that a great modern city can only function on a basis of strict order, Le Corbusier presents two imposing schemes for urban reconstruction &#x2014; the "Voisin" scheme for the center of Paris, and his more developed plans for the "City of Three Million Inhabitants," which envisioned, among other things, 60-story skyscrapers, set well apart, to house commercial activities, and residential housing grouped in great blocks of "villas."<br>For those who live in cities as well as anyone interested in their planning, here is a probing survey of the problems of modern urban life and a master architect's stimulating vision of how they might be solved, enlivened by the innovative spirit and passionate creativity that distinguished all of Le Corbusier's work.</p><p></p></p><p>Swiss-born architect, urban planner, sculptor, painter, and writer Le Corbusier (1887-1956), born Charles-�douard Jeanneret, was one of the most influential architects of the twentieth century and one of the leading figures of architectural modernism.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Songs of Milarepa (Dover Thrift Editions: Poetry)</h2><p>A Buddhist holy man whose songs have been sung and studied since the twelfth century, Milarepa exchanged a life of sin and maliciousness for one of contemplation and love, eventually reaching&#x2014;according to his disciples&#x2014;the ultimate state of enlightenment.

She was a teacher, with two class sections of doctors who wanted to help solve crimes. Students who seemed so young, teenagers, almost, though many were in their twenties, and even thirties. Untouched by tragedy; unknowing of the world's painful embrace.<br><br>They'd learn soon enough, especially with her at the helm. She'd seen more than most in her career, especially during her tenure as the Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Tennessee. Her job was to teach them everything she knew so they could stride out into the world in pursuit of justice.<br><br>The way she used to do.<br><br>Sam turned from the window to her desk, a thick slab of oak polished to a high gleam, and casually straightened the stack of papers in her out-box. Her OCD was under strict rein, especially in front of all these new people, but there was no need for things to be messy.<br><br>She should be eager for this new life to begin. She honestly had been, until a few weeks ago, when her friend John Baldwin, from the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit, sat her down and threw a bomb into her world. Sent her spinning, unsure of all the choices she'd made over the past few months.<br><br>He'd come to town for a case two weeks earlier, taken her out for lunch and, before the food arrived, got straight to business.<br><br><em>"I wish you 'd talked to me before you made this drastic change."</em><br><br><em>"It's the best thing for me. I don't want to be out there anymore, Baldwin. I paid my dues, with more than I care to remember."</em><br><br><em>"Which is why I'm here. We want you to join the FBI."</em><br><br><em>She choked on the water the server had set down. "Excuse me?"</em><br><br><em>"You heard me. We need your mind."</em><br><br><em>She laughed. "I'm a medical examiner, Baldwin, or I was. Not a field agent. For starters, I hate guns."</em><br><br><em>"I know. That's not a problem. You 'd be an official consultant, mostly with me and my team, but with other parts of the Bureau, too, depending on the cases. You' d need to go through some training at the Academy in Quantico, to make it all official, but you'll be able to work on cases again. Sam, you can't tell me you don't miss it."</em><br><br><em>"I don't. Not at all."</em><br><br><em>"You're lying to yourself."</em><br><br>Watching the students wander the campus, Sam wondered if he was right. Did she belong here? Innocent faces glued to smartphones, earbuds firmly embedded in ears, an insouciant walk; these kids didn't seem to have a care in the world. What if she wasn't cool enough for them?<br><br>"Right. There's the thing to worry about. Being cool."<br><br>She settled at the desk and opened her laptop. Debated putting in her own earbuds; decided she was being silly. She knew her lesson plan cold, but giving it one more look wouldn't hurt; she hated using notes. Regardless of the doubt she was feeling, she was here to engage these young doctors, intrigue them, but also allow them a glimpse into the real world of forensic pathology. Not the exciting, tumultuous world they saw on television, but the bloody, messy, heart-wrenching process of dissection, both of bodies and of lives. To show them the hardest truth of all: the dead have no secrets. But the living do.<br><br>Forget the notes. Maybe she'd just read for a bit, settle into her office. Adjust to the sights and sounds of her new life.<br><br>She was deep into an article on forensic ballistics when a soft knock pulled her from her review. She looked up to see Xander in her doorway, a grin on his face.<br><br>"Hey," he said.<br><br>Her stomach flipped, as it always did when he caught her unawares. A biological response to an emotion none truly understood. An emotion she was grateful for, because she knew the depth of it had saved her from sinking into the deepest abyss.<br><br>Alexander Whitfield. Known to his parents and family as Moonbeam, or Xander Moon. A true misnomer for a tough former army ranger. And Xander was still a ranger through and through: intense, alert, always combing the background for unseen threats. Romantic, and a fatalist. Just like her.<br><br>He was a different man now than the one she'd met several months before. More open, more forgiving. Happier. They'd settled into a version of domestic bliss, splitting their time between her Georgetown town house and his cabin in the backwoods of the Savage River Forest.<br><br>He'd separated from the army the previous year after the terrible cover-up of a friendly fire incident that had killed one of his best friends. He'd run to the woods, disengaged from the world and would have stayed there, lost and alone, if it weren't for Sam. Two broken souls, made whole by their joining.<br><br>Xander wasn't fully ready to reenter the world, but he was coming back, a bit at a time. Though he'd done his best to hide it, she knew he was happy she had turned down Baldwin's job offer.<br><br>"Hey," she said. "What are you doing here?"<br><br>"I thought I'd bring you lunch. I know how you can lose yourself in your work. What is it today? Blood spatter?"<br><br>"It's eerie how you do that." She turned the laptop around and showed him the article. "I was just starting the section on backspatter."<br><br>He didn't pale, but his lips tightened together in a grim line. He'd spent most of his life behind the trigger; he was more than familiar with the concept.<br><br>Sam glanced at the screen, saw the full-color image of a man at the wrong end of a shotgun and slammed the laptop closed. "Sorry. What's this about lunch?"<br><br>Xander's dark hair flopped onto his forehead. "You're not one of those M.E.s who can eat a tuna sandwich standing over a corpse, are you?"<br><br>"Highly unethical behavior, tuna eating. I'd stick with cookies or crackers myself. The crumbs are easier to brush away."<br><br>He laughed, deep from his belly, which made her smile. She loved his laugh.<br><br>"I wouldn't kick you out of bed for eating crackers." He glanced over his shoulder at the open office door. "Maybe we should inaugurate your office."<br><br>He kissed her, long and lingering, and she was damn close to saying <em>lock the door</em> when another knock sounded, this one accompanied by a high-pitched throat clearing. They jumped apart like teenagers caught making out on a porch, and Sam smoothed her shirt down&#x2014;good grief, one of her buttons was undone; how had he managed that?&#x2014;before turning to see who'd so rudely interrupted them.<br><br>It was one of her new T.A.s, Stephanie Wilhelm, a slight blonde with a sharp sense of humor to match her highly unorthodox look&#x2014;today a black Metallica concert T-shirt under a black men's pin-striped jacket and dark jeans tucked into leather combat boots. Sam liked the girl. Her independence among the clones had landed her the coveted T.A. position in the first place.<br><br>"Forgive me, Dr. Owens, but this letter arrived for you. It's marked urgent. I thought I should bring it to you right away."<br><br>Her words were directed to Sam, but her eyes were locked on Xander, who was sitting on the edge of Sam's desk, arms crossed on his broad chest, vibrating in amusement as he watched her fumble with her button.<br><br>"Thank you, Stephanie. I appreciate it."<br><br>"If you need anything else..." She dropped off, winked lasciviously.<br><br>"Out," Sam said, and Stephanie left with a grin.<br><br>"I'm hot for teacher," Xander said, and Sam swatted him with the letter.<br><br>"Quit it. The last thing I need is a reputation for looseness among my students." She sat on the desk next to him and opened the letter. Thick strokes of black ink, the words slanted to the right. A man's handwriting.<br><br>She read the first line, felt the breath leave her body.<br><br>"Uh-oh."<br><br>Xander caught her tone. "What's wrong?"<br><br>She scanned the rest of the letter. "You need to hear this." She read it aloud, vaguely noticed her voice was shaking.<br><br><em>"Dear Dr. Owens,</em><br><br><em>If you are reading this letter, I am dead. I would be most grateful if you would solve my murder. I know how determined you are, and talented. If anyone can figure out this mess, it's you.</em><br><br><em>I've compiled a list of suspects for you to look at, and set aside some money to cover your expenses. I fear your life may be in danger once they find I've contacted you, so I urge you to take every precaution. Yours,</em><br><br><em>Timothy R. Savage"</em><br><br>"Let me see that." Xander took the letter from her, barely touching the corner between his thumb and forefinger. Sam watched his face as he read it, saw the darkness draw over him like a shroud.<br><br>"Who the hell is Timothy Savage?"<br><br>"I have no idea. But it's a pretty sick joke. Who would do such a thing?"<br><br>"I don't know. John Baldwin, maybe? Trying to draw you into a case against your will?"<br><br>She opened her mouth to deny the possibility, but stopped herself. She'd known Baldwin for many years. He was engaged to her best friend. He was a good man, a no-nonsense cop in addition to being a talented profiler. He wouldn't resort to manipulation. Would he?<br><br>"No. It's not him."<br><br>Xander shrugged. "Where's the envelope?"<br><br>In her surprise, she'd dropped it on the floor. She pulled a tissue from the box on her desk and picked it up, careful not to directly touch any part of it. Ridiculous, she'd already gotten her prints all over it, so had Stephanie and countless others, but she had to treat it as evidence now.<br><br>"Return address is Lynchburg, Virginia," she said. "Let me plug it into my laptop, see if it's real."<br><br>He read the information to her, and she entered it into Google. The name Timothy Savage popped up, along with a map of his address, and a death notice from the local Lynchburg paper.<br><br>"Oh, no. Xander, Timothy Savage really is dead."<br><br>Xander breathed hard out his nose. "Then Sam, honey, you better call Fletcher. This might not be a joke, after all."</p><h2>Survey Graphic: Harlem Mecca of the New Negro</h2><p>Harlem Mecca is an indispensable aid toward gaining a better understanding of the Harlem Renaissance.The contributors to this edition include W.E.B Du Bois, Arthur Schomburg, James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes, and Countee Cullen.</p><p>This reproduction of a groundbreaking issue of the social-science magazine <i>Survey Graphic</i> contains some of the seminal writings of the Harlem Renaissance.

At its heart beats the 999-line poem, "Pale Fire," penned by the distinguished American poet John Shade. This first-ever facsimile edition of the poem shows it to be not just a fictional device but a masterpiece of American poetry, albeit by an invented persona -- "the greatest of invented poets," according to Nabokov's own accurate evaluation. In the novel Shade's mad neighbor, Charles Kinbote, absconds with the index-card manuscript of the poem, compiling an ostensible line-by-line commentary that largely ignores Shade's text and heeds only his own egotism. Kinbote's commentary, the bulk of the novel, is an insane comic triumph of would-be romantic self-celebration that cannot quite mute its undertones of desperation. But here we rescue "Pale Fire" from the madman's hand to show the magician's sleight of hand, and the enchantment, in Nabokov's most ambitious poem. <p> Renowned Nabokov authority Brian Boyd brilliantly explains "Pale Fire" on its and Shade's own terms, showing how its texture compares with Shakespeare's sonnets at their best. Poet R.S. Gwynn sets it in the context of American poetry of its time. Artist Jean Holabird, who conceived the project, illustrates key details of the poem's pattern and pathos. </p><p> Now readers can see the text for themselves, fresh from Shade's hands, before Kinbote commandeered it so shamelessly. </p><p> This attractive box contains two bookletsthe poem "Pale Fire" in a handsome pocket edition and the book of essays by Boyd and Gwynnas well as facsimiles of the index cards that John Shade (like his maker, Nabokov) used for composing his poem, printed exactly as Vladimir Nabokov described them.</p>Brian Boyd is University Distinguished Professor of English at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.

Instead he examines more than five centuries of remarkable historical evidence of cultural and political interaction between Blacks and Asians around the world, in which they have exchanged cultural and religious symbols, appropriated personas and lifestyles, and worked together to achieve political change.</p><p>Vijay Prashad is director and associate professor of international studies at Trinity College and the author of <i>The Karma of Brown Folk.</i> He lives in Northampton, Massachusetts.In this brilliant exploration of the often surprising historical solidarities linking black and South Asian experiences, Prashad demolishes the conservative conceits of ethnic essentialism and so-called multiculturalism. In the usual dead zone of debate about identity politics, this little book is a refreshing oasis of original insight and unexpected affinity. -Mike Davis, author of <i>City of Quartz</i> and <i>Magical Urbanism</i><br><br>"Finally! A book that just might bring an end to all the silly talk of 'identity politics.' Vijay Prashad's powerful, original essays reveal that neither brown skins nor cultural commonalities explain the long and dynamic history of Afro-Asian solidarity. Rather, the answer lay in dreams of emancipation, dreams borne of Empire but nourished in the imaginations of so-called colored people who had to learn to trust each other in the trenches.

In recent years, however, leading Russian figures, including former president Vladimir Putin, have begun to stress a geopolitics that puts Russia at the center of a number of axes: European-Asian, Christian-Muslim-Buddhist, Mediterranean-Indian, Slavic-Turkic, and so on. </p><p>This volume examines the political presuppositions and expanding intellectual impact of Eurasianism, a movement promoting an ideology of Russian-Asian greatness, which has begun to take hold throughout Russia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey. Eurasianism purports to tell Russians what is unalterably important about them and why it can only be expressed in an empire. Using a wide range of sources, Marl�ne Laruelle discusses the impact of the ideology of Eurasianism on geopolitics, interior policy, foreign policy, and culturalist philosophy.</p></p><p><p>Since the dissolution of the USSR, an ideology promoting Russian-Asian greatness<br>has taken hold among an influential group of Russian scholars and intellectuals.

Today many think of it as a discipline that belongs only in monasteries&#x2014;but psalmody is a spiritual treasure that is available to anyone who prays. You don&#x2019;t need to be musical or a monk to do it, and it can be enjoyed in church liturgical worship, in groups, or even individually as part of a personal rule of prayer. Cynthia Bourgeault brings the practice into the twenty-first century, providing a history of Christian psalmody as well as an appreciation of its place in contemplative practice today. And she teaches you how to do it as you chant along with her on the accompanying CD in which she demonstrates the basic techniques and easy melodies that anyone can learn. &#x201c;Even if you can&#x2019;t read music,&#x201d; Cynthia says, &#x201c;or if somewhere along the way you&#x2019;ve absorbed the message that your voice is no good or you can&#x2019;t sing on pitch, I&#x2019;ll still hope to show you that chanting the psalms is accessible to nearly everyone.&#x201d;</p><p>Cynthia Bourgeault, PhD, is an Episcopal priest, teacher, and retreat and conference leader. She is the author of several books, including <i>Chanting the Psalms</i> and <i>Centering Prayer and Inner Awakening</i>.<i>Starred Review.</i> The pointed and shaking finger of our adamant inner schoolteachers often accompanies calls to engage and stick with ancient (read: tried and proven) spiritual practices. Not so with Bourgeault's impassioned invitation to chant the Psalms. With a blend of Christian and Eastern mysticism running throughout, as well as recognition that learning to chant may be difficult, she gently guides readers through the "whys" and then through the "hows." Bourgeault, an Episcopal priest with a doctorate in medieval studies/musicology, clearly knows her material, but presents it simply; see the chapter on "Suzuki Psalmnody." The companion CD, illustrating the various techniques, encourages even the most vocally challenged reader to try the chants. Bourgeault's focus is not only on chanting, but on chanting the Psalms specifically, asserting that chanting them helps to integrate the shadow and heal the personal unconscious, as well as awaken the intuitive imagination. The book's final section explores other contemporary and popular forms of chant and song, including Taiz� and Iona. Bourgeault will be a helpful guide to those who seek to find a viable daily Christian practice, while those who already have a daily discipline may find that her suggestions for chanting deepens and enlarges their experience. <i>(Dec. 12)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Intimate and revealing, this masterful compilation offers fans and scholars generous and unprecedented insight into the life of one of our most significant poets.</p></p><p><p>Sylvia Plath was born in 1932 in Massachusetts. Her books include the poetry collections <em>The Colossus</em>, <em>Crossing the Water</em>, <em>Winter Trees</em>, <em>Ariel</em>, and <em>Collected Poems</em>, which won the Pulitzer Prize. A complete and uncut facsimile edition of <em>Ariel</em> was published in 2004 with her original selection and arrangement of poems.

Night</h2><p>Provides a glittering odyssey through the glamorous dance scene in fashionable Los Angeles, offering a close-up look at the dancers, music, nightlife, hot dance spots, celebrities, and more.</p><p><i>Two by Two</i> is a whirlwind tour of the Los Angeles dancing scene by Eve Babitz, who has made a career of delineating the social comedies of L.A. Here, in a series of loosely connected chapters, she talks with instructors of various forms of social dance--including tango, salsa, country two-step, and both East and West Coast swing--about why dancing has become so popular again, even with all the difficulties of learning the steps. The story does not so much progress in a linear direction as it orbits around a shifting core, propelled by the occasionally sparkling dialogue. Apart from a sharply unexpected dose of reality in the book's epilogue, <i>Two by Two</i> occupies a pleasantly hazy daydream that, while it may or may not inspire you to hit the dance floor, reveals the charms that Babitz and her friends have found there.Forget Arthur Murray, or those dreaded dance classes your mother made you take. Two by Two is a fast-paced swirl through the dancing scene in L.A., where Leonardo DiCaprio has been known to swing at The Derby and Sandra Bullock salsas at El Floridita. Eve Babitz, a writer known for her hip, off-the-cuff, idiosyncratic style, spends two years of her life, ruins nine pairs of shoes, and goes through countless dance partners learning to appreciate and master all the hot dances from foxtrot and two-step to lindy, tango, salsa, and swing. Along the way she meets obsessed dancers and listens night after night as they pour out the secrets of their style -- who the best teachers are, where to find the perfect dancing shoes, and how to fall in love with your partner.<p>Though the entire country is engaged in this dance revival, the L.A. scene is particularly alive, Babitz finds, because there have always been people in Los Angeles who insist on going out and being "in the scene", and plenty of music, charm, colorful groups of people, and adventure to lure them. She attributes the dance craze to the fact that singles bars died when people sobered up and realized just how abysmal that scene was. Drawn by the vivacious and electric dance scene, people now meet others who come for lessons, and immediately embrace the ambition to be as one with the music, the night, and someone, maybe you.</p><p>Eve brings the flirtatious energy of dancing alive like no other writer. She describes salsa as "a dance of contradictions". "On the one hand, you want to 'be small, ' as people who lead you will say if your steps are too big. But on the other hand, you want to stagger your competition by the immensity of yourintensity. You want your own smoldering pride and divine fire to consume the room, and yet you want to hardly move". Two by Two is not a book that teaches you how to dance, but it will surely make you want to learn once you've read it.</p></p><h2>The Murder Stone: A Novel of Suspense</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A stunner, exquisitely plotted and characterized, with Todd&#x2019;s trademark meticulous backdrop of World War I-era England.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Strand</i> Magazine<br></b><br>The Great War is still raging when Francesca Hatton&#x2019;s adored grandfather dies on the family estate in England&#x2019;s isolated Exe Valley.

At the center of the intrigue is an unusual white stone hidden in a garden where Francesca once played with her five male cousins&#x2014;all dead now on France&#x2019;s battlefields.

Maybe never well enough, to judge by the example of Francesca Hatton, the young British heiress around whom Charles Todd constructs his first standalone historical suspense tale, <i>The Murder Stone</i>. Leaving London and her volunteer work with wounded World War I soldiers, Francesca--"the last of the Hattons ... [a] long and distinguished line"--returns in 1916 to River's End, the rural estate where her powerful and beloved grandfather is dying of a stroke. Francis Hatton's passing hits Francesca hard, especially coming so soon after the demise of her five male cousins, all of them "mown down with their dreams of glory" in battle. But her mourning is interrupted by multiple mysteries. Why did Francis insist in his will that the Murder Stone, a large and cryptically named white rock in his garden, be moved to the farthest corner of Scotland? Why had he concealed his ownership of two other, distant estates? And could there be any truth in the charge, leveled by an invalided soldier, that Francis long ago "abducted and killed his mother, then buried the body where it couldn't be found"? Forced by new revelations to rebalance her faith in the man who'd taken her in as an orphaned child, while simultaneously contending with a random sniper who's invaded the neighborhood of River's End, Francesca struggles to build a new future, even as her trust in the "facts" of her past crumbles.<p> Over the course of six previous novels, beginning with <i>A Test of Wills</i>--all featuring shell-shocked soldier-turned-inspector Ian Rutledge--Todd (the nom de plume of a mother-son writing team) has shown considerable skill in formulating criminal conundrums against the backdrop of post-World War I Britain. <i>The Murder Stone</i> vividly recaptures the nation in the very midst of that international violence, a painful period of untimely deaths and stunning Zeppelin raids. However, this yarn is as much a Gothic romance as an abstruse puzzler. Most of the secrets here can be figured out faster by the average reader than by the incredibly na�ve Francesca. And with the exception of that vexed protagonist, whose investigations paint her into ever tighter moral corners, none of this novel's characters achieve much dimension. They're mechanical players in a drama that is surprising mostly for its failure to surprise. <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>Charles Todd's critically acclaimed novels featuring Scotland Yard Inspector Ian Rutledge have been hailed by The Washington Post Book World as "one of the best historical series being written today." The New York Times Book Review calls Todd's mysteries "meticulously wrought...harrowing psychological drama." Now he stakes out new territory in this mesmerizing stand-alone novel of one woman's dark journey through family obsession, wartime secrets, and a chilling legacy.... <br>The Murder Stone <br>The Great War is still raging in the autumn of 1916, when Francesca Hatton's beloved grandfather dies on the family estate in <br>England's isolated Exe Valley. Grieving for the man who raised her, Francesca is stunned to find an unsigned letter among his effects, cursing the Hattons and their descendants. Now a stranger has shown up on her doorstep, accusing her grandfather of being a murderer. <br>Ex-soldier Richard Leighton blames Francis Hatton for the death of his mother, who vanished nearly a quarter of a century earlier. Her body was never found, only a shawl stained with her blood. And Leighton is not the only one with a claim on Francesca's grandfather. On the day of his funeral, unexpected visitors arrive with the mourners, and Francesca is besieged by charges of Hatton's vicious dealings. Yet there is also a shy young woman who praises his secret generosity. <br>At the center of the intrigue is an unusual white stone that lies hidden in a secluded garden where Francesca once played with her five male cousins, all of them dead now on the battlefields of France. According to the terms of Hatton's will, the Murder Stone must be dug up and transported to Scotland, where it is to beburied forever. But before Francesca can begin the journey, a series of ominous "accidents" occur, culminating in the discovery of a bleeding body on the Murder Stone itself. <br>Was Hatton the loving, caring protector his granddaughter always believed him to be? <br>Or a vindictive, secretive man who cultivated dangerous enemies? Francesca sets out in pursuit of the truth--and into the sights of someone determined to exact a revenge long overdue. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Shetland Folk Tales (Folk Tales: United Kingdom)</h2><p>As a child, Lawrence learned many folk tales from his father, Tom Tulloch.

However, that&#x2019;s not to say that the Sumerians, Victorians, and every civilization in between and beyond have not tried, wielding their most formidable weapon: the law. At any given point in time, some forms of sex were condoned while others were punished mercilessly. Jump forward or backward a century or two (and often far less than that), and the harmless fun of one time period becomes the gravest crime in another. <i>Sex and Punishment</i> tells the story of the struggle throughout the millennia to regulate the most powerful engine of human behavior.<br><br>Writer and lawyer Eric Berkowitz uses flesh-and-blood cases much flesh and even more blood to evoke the entire sweep of Western sex law, from the savage impalement of an ancient Mesopotamian adulteress to the imprisonment of Oscar Wilde in 1895 for gross indecency.&#x201d; The cast of <i>Sex and Punishment</i> is as varied as the forms taken by human desire itself: royal mistresses, gay charioteers, medieval transvestites, lonely goat-lovers, prostitutes of all stripes, London rent boys. Each of them had forbidden sex, and each was judged and justice, as Berkowitz shows, rarely had much to do with it.<br><br>With the light touch of a natural storyteller, Berkowitz spins these tales and more, going behind closed doors to reveal the essential history of human desire.<br></p><p><b>Eric Berkowitz</b> is a writer, lawyer and journalist.

It has the wisdom granted by perspective, without the condescension of someone who thinks we&#39;re wiser than our ancestors. Whether you want to fuel your indignation, or simply furnish yourself with enough jaw-dropping data to galvanise a hundred party conversations, you really must shell out for this book. It&#39;s worth every penny.&#34; Nicholas Lezard, Guardian &#34;At once broad-ranging and rich in detail, Berkowitz s cross examination of human sexuality is both exciting and impressively relentless.&#34; James McConnachie, Sunday Times &#34;...throughout history men and women have been forced to pay a fearful price for doing what to the birds and bees comes naturally. As Eric Berkowitz points out in this fascinating and gruesomely compelling study of human sexuality, the consequences for those whose proclivities fall outside the boundaries of convention have generally proved devastating.&#34; Simon Griffith, Mail on Sunday &#34;Stimulating - Berkowitz has achieved a perfect balance between case study and analysis, and between narrative and reflection. - This is a wonderfully well-written, well-organised and accomplished book. But it comes with a health warning. 350 pages of sex resulting in impalement or a barbed fish up the bottom may have a deleterious effect on the libido.&#39; Sara Wheeler, Literary Review &#34;Throughout Berkowitz smoothly straddles the divide between the explicit and the subtle, the ridiculous and the sublime...Sex and Punishment constantly reminds us not to be complacent about past victories - nor to rest until genuine equality has been won, from the barricades to the bedroom.&#34; Socialist Review &#34;An illuminating and deftly told account of the two urges that have done so much to define civilization: humanity s appetite for sex and its concern to regulate the consequences. As Eric Berkowitz shows, both impulses have been in flux for centuries, and his colourful history serves as a timely reminder of just how arbitrary and ludicrous the moral certainties of one era can appear to the next.&#34; Sadakat Kadri, author of &#39;The Trial: A History, from Socrates to O.

Closest to the sand, liquid the pale green of a fertile lake. Then a swath of aquamarine, the color you imagine reading the word: aqua as in water, marine as in sea. Finally, a deep blue, the color of pigment, paint squirting fresh from a tin tube. Sylvia Plath, writing in her journal the month she met Ted Hughes, the day, no, the day before: &#x201c;What word blue could get that dazzling drench of blue moonlight on the flat, luminous field of white snow, with the black trees against the sky, each with its particular configuration of branches?&#x201d; No matter the snow, the black trees. The sea was that color, the color of what word blue.<br><br>I was reading Plath&#x2019;s journals that summer because I was twenty-one and daffy with sensation, drunk with it. And for the kind of person who goes straight from a major in English to a graduate program for study of same&#x2014;that is, for me&#x2014;The Journals of Sylvia Plath, 1950&#x2013;1962, republished that year, unabridged, counts as pleasure reading. They met, Sylvia and Ted did, in February, and were married in June, on the sixteenth, Bloomsday. That was on purpose. On purpose and a dead giveaway&#x2014;that they shouldn&#x2019;t have done it I mean, get married. The youthful symbolism of it. Or one of, anyway. One of the dead giveaways. This was, I was, in Otranto, in August. The sea was three shades of what might have been called blue and I was both on vacation and not.<br><br>Camila&#x2019;s parents were Argentinian psychoanalysts and I was on vacation in that they had paid for my flight from New York to London and from London to Rome and from Rome to Brindisi and for the train from Brindisi to Otranto and also for the resort at which we were staying, which was tiered and terraced, smooth-walled and all-inclusive and so theoretically I could order, from the lounge chairs, whitewashed and wooden-slatted, as many drinks as I wanted. Though practically I couldn&#x2019;t because the reason the flights and the train and the room had been paid for, the reason I was with Camila and her parents at all, was that Camila had twin brothers, seven years old, and it was my job to mind them. Matteo and Tom�s, Tom�s smaller and fairer and Matteo, his torso tanned, his hair dark and curly, always getting mistaken for a local. Because of the name, too&#x2014;Artemisia&#x2019;s father was Italian, hence the spelling. They lived on the Upper West Side, Artemisia and the boys and her husband, Pablo, they were of Argentinian extraction. Camila and I were friends, was another point in the vacation column.<br><br>The first two weeks were the hardest. The boys had a nanny back in New York, also Argentinian, but August was her month off, too, and with me at first they had mutinied, as children will do when surrendered to new authority. They couldn&#x2019;t have known precisely why I was reluctant to run from their room to their parents&#x2019; room, double-checking what it was they were and weren&#x2019;t supposed to be eating and watching, how late they were or weren&#x2019;t supposed to stay up, but they must have sensed it, my reluctance. My all-encompassing apprehension. Artemisia had given me only parameters&#x2014;not too many sweets; keep an eye on your wine, they&#x2019;ll try to tip it into their Coca-Cola&#x2014;and a different woman would have understood this as license, a different woman would have known, from Artemisia&#x2019;s eye makeup, from the long shift dresses she wore, sleeveless, from the bracelets that busied her arm, slender and golden, from her sunglasses and scarves, from the fact that Pablo had only ever spoken to me directly three times and never about the children, that the rules were mine to make. But I was an uncertain girl, weak of will and ego, and I wanted Artemisia and Pablo to like me, Artemisia in particular because it was immediately obvious, from her shift dresses and her bracelets and also from the way Pablo angled his head when he spoke to me, so that his eyes, and he was already short, were looking not quite at my face, that her approval would be the harder won. I lived in fear, those first few weeks, that Tom�s and Matteo, Teo we called him, so that they were Tom and Teo, the o in Tom narrow, closed, so that it sounded not at all like an abbreviation for the American Thomas, would run to their parents and tell them their new nanny was just awful and couldn&#x2019;t they send her away. Like I was in some knockoff Henry James novel, some knockoff Merchant Ivory adaptation of same.<br><br>And so that was the first week, me trying to deny them this treat or that privilege and them complaining and me giving in immediately, buying them bomboloni in the morning and cornetti in the afternoon and them having no appetite for dinner at eight and demanding to stay up for the eleven-fifteen movie on Retequattro, the boys whining, So what that it&#x2019;s rated red, which is how Tom and Teo fell asleep watching Basic Instinct, me thinking, Well surely it&#x2019;s been edited for broadcast and certainly it&#x2019;s been dubbed and really how much Italian can they really understand, even with the fluent grandfather, the cognates. Like the language was the problem. I did keep my eye on my wine.<br><br>The second week was worse because they&#x2019;d tired, already, of getting what they wanted, the desire, in these cases, being not merely to get what one wants but to feel as if one is getting away with getting what one wants, and so they began to create actual trouble, trouble of the damaging-the-hotel variety, which is how I found myself, on the evening of the tenth night, yelling, for the first time really shouting at Teo to stop using the serrated dinner knife to try to liberate the feathers from a pillow. He responded wonderfully, stopped right away and only cried a little, ate his frutti di mare quietly, didn&#x2019;t ask after a gelato or a chocolate profiterole. And the whole time: his eyes wide, a small smile on his lips, pink and wet, hoping for a smile in return, a nod of approval. It&#x2019;s true what they say, children really do crave boundaries. By they I mean Artemisia.<br><br>The day before the serrated-knife incident, early afternoon, the boys, sun-drunk from a morning at the beach, asleep, small Speedos sandy, limbs splayed, breathing deeply, drooling, I&#x2019;d knocked on Artemisia&#x2019;s door. Come in, she said, and I opened the door and found Artemisia in her bathing suit. Come in, she said again, because I had not yet crossed the door&#x2019;s threshold. I stepped into the room and Artemisia turned away from me, bent to untie the knots of fabric at her neck and at her spine that were holding the top of her bikini in place. Close the door, she said. I did and when I turned back around she was facing me. Her breasts were heavy and low, freckled, her nipples the color of walnuts, roasted, wrinkled, too, in a way that suggested they might have a similar texture. I mean none of this critically. Her nipples pointed not down but ahead. All of this I absorbed in a second, half, my eyes flying up to meet hers. I&#x2019;m wondering, I said, about discipline. How you usually discipline the boys. The boys, Artemisia said, crave boundaries. All children do. The precise boundaries matter less than the fact of their existence. Tell them, Artemisia continued, what it is they must not do and when they do it anyway, she shrugged, punish them. As she shrugged, her breasts perked and then flattened. Her hands were on her hips and her fingers framed a gentle fullness, not a proper roundedness but a kind of visible exhalation, evidence, the only visible on her body, that she&#x2019;d twice been pregnant, given birth. Her feet were shoulder width apart and her thighs, also freckled, did not quite touch. Punish them? I asked. I was looking only at her face. Yes, she said, a time-out, no dessert, penalties of that sort. She shrugged again. Though I suspect you will not need to go even that far. If you raise your voice. She smiled. They are timid boys. They are very eager to please. She bent down and I saw she was beginning to remove the bottom of her bikini as well so I nodded quickly and turned and left, closing the door behind me forgetting to thank her for the advice she had given me, forgetting even to acknowledge it.<br><br>So then it was the third week and the boys had gotten used to me and I to them, opposing armies on Christmas morning agreeing to an armistice, trading presents, one cono alla vaniglia in exchange for forty-five minutes of playing in the sand, no swimming, Nanny wants to read for a bit. I was watching them from my lounge chair, this was a day or two later, when a shadow fell across my legs. Boundaries, no? The voice belonged to Artemisia. You tell them that they can play in the water but that they must not swim and indeed, that is precisely what they do. I nodded. Teo was splashing Tom and Tom was turning to run. Keep your feet on the sand, I&#x2019;d said. Stay where I can see you. Artemisia bent and her shadow moved up my body. Sylvia Plath, she said, reading the spine of the book I&#x2019;d placed facedown on my knees. Not a very good poet, she said. But yes, an interesting person.<br><br>It was that night, or maybe the night after, after I&#x2019;d fed the boys and put them down and had dinner with the family and Camila had left to meet friends she&#x2019;d made on the beach and Pablo had left to see if he could use the resort&#x2019;s telephone to make an international call, that Artemisia again approached me. I was sitting on the terrace, onto which both my room and the suite&#x2019;s living room opened, a glass of white wine on the table in front of me and also a few sheets of paper. In my right hand a pen, blue, my second and third fingers stained with its ink. Artemisia was wearing a white linen shift and she was carrying a bottle of white and also a glass and she asked if she could sit and when I said yes I could feel the vein in my neck begin to throb, just slightly. I&#x2019;m not, she said, disturbing you? And when I said no she asked what I was writing and I said, A letter to my boyfriend, and then, Or, not my boyfriend, we broke up, before the summer. This was not quite accurate. I&#x2019;m going to graduate school, I added. He didn&#x2019;t want to follow you? Artemisia asked. I laughed and she frowned and I said, quickly, It&#x2019;s just that I&#x2019;m young and he&#x2019;s got a job in New York and it didn&#x2019;t, a helpless hand gesture, come up. If we&#x2019;d been, and here I paused because I hadn&#x2019;t yet lied outright and didn&#x2019;t want to, didn&#x2019;t want to lie to her, and yet explaining the situation also seemed impossible, but then Artemisia smiled and I stopped talking, relieved. Ready, she said. You were going to say, If we&#x2019;d been ready. Ready to get married, yes? This was not what I had been going to say. Of course it was true that I wasn&#x2019;t ready to get married, but this wasn&#x2019;t the problem, the problem was that my boyfriend, who was also my former professor, already was. Nevertheless I nodded. No one is ever really ready, she said. She removed, from a pocket in her shift dress, a pack of cigarettes, a brand I&#x2019;d never seen in the States, Diana, the package white, trimmed in pale blue, and asked, Do you mind? She was already lighting the cigarette, even as I was shaking my head no, no, of course I didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>My first husband, she said, exhaling. I met him <br><br>at university, in Buenos Aires, while I was completing my bachelor&#x2019;s. I, too, had decided to go to graduate school, for psychology. I had been accepted at Columbia. Very prestigious. Especially for a foreigner. Someone not fluent in the language. She poured herself a glass of wine from the bottle she&#x2019;d brought, took a sip. I suspect, she said, that Camila&#x2019;s admission was due in part to my own. Given her more limited powers, intellectually. Her lack of extracurricular interests. Though I do not know how heavily a parent&#x2019;s graduate attendance weighs on a child&#x2019;s undergraduate application. And of course Pablo was once a professor there as well. This may have counted more. She took another sip.<br><br>It was late, almost midnight. We ate late because of the heat and even now it was still warm enough that neither of us had sweaters on. Artemisia&#x2019;s shift was sleeveless and I was wearing a tank top, spaghetti-strapped, and olive-green shorts with small cargo pockets just above the hem. As she spoke I nudged my tank top down so that no skin was exposed between its bottom and the top of my shorts. My legs had been perched on the seat of the table&#x2019;s third chair, but now, feeling the weight of her gaze on the expanse of my too-pale flesh, I crossed my right leg over my left, hooked my right foot behind my left ankle, tucked my feet beneath my chair. As she spoke I watched her lips move, watched her neck. I wished, despite the heat, for a blanket to drape over my lap so that the contours of my lower body might disappear entirely beneath it.<br><br>Artemisia&#x2019;s judgment, what she had said about her daughter, it was harsh but I did not dispute it, both because I believed it to be true and also because I was familiar with the P�rez family policy, which was honesty in all things. If she was telling me this she had certainly told her daughter as well, in the same spirit in which Camila had told me, during our first week in Otranto, that she would rather spend her time with the six young Greek tourists she had met on the beach than with me and her brothers; the same spirit in which she had, during the first months of our acquaintance, informed me that I should never wear heels with straps, even T-straps, because the place on my ankle where the circular strap hit shortened my calf and made it appear not only pudgy but meatlike, not a calf but a shank being served on a platter of shoe. It wasn&#x2019;t that Camila and I weren&#x2019;t friends, it was, precisely, that we were. And if both of us had imagined my taking care of her brothers as a way, the only way, to spend this last summer together, given her money and my relative lack thereof, it was Camila who had first realized that to preserve the friendship she would have to abandon me. Or not to preserve it, for the friendship was lost anyway, in the fall I would go to graduate school and Camila would remain in New York, but to honor its memory. So yes, it&#x2019;s true that when I think of Camila that summer, what I see are the backs of her thighs as she walks away from me, down the beach, toward the Greeks, or maybe they were Germans. But at least I don&#x2019;t see her treating me like the help. This I now consider a kindness. Anyway I didn&#x2019;t dispute Artemisia&#x2019;s judgment, instead I nodded and sipped my wine and Artemisia continued. My boyfriend at the time. I met him at university. He was not a fellow student. He was a professor. My professor. Perhaps now the situation would be seen differently. But at the time I was not at a disadvantage. Or I did not see myself as at a disadvantage. We did not begin our relationship until after I had completed his course. And in any case the problems that developed were not related to this initial power imbalance. She shook her head. Not in my opinion. They would have developed no matter. In any case. But I was saying. When I moved to New York, he followed me. He would not admit to this. He was not the kind of man who would follow a woman to a different town. Much less to a different country. But it so happened that he was offered a fellowship for one year to teach not at Columbia but at Sarah Lawrence. The university gave him a leave of absence. We married. For reasons of a bureaucratic nature. Perhaps visas were easier to obtain. Possibly the taxes were lower. In any case. When I left Buenos Aires, it was with him.</p><h2>The Invisible Garment: 30 Spiritual Principles That Weave the Fabric of Human Life</h2><p>In The Invisible Garment, Kaplan has expertly laid out 30 spiritual principles that weave the fabric of human life and make up the body of a spiritual wardrobe&#x2014;a person&#x2019;s spiritual DNA. Through the principles, we learn how to maintain our spiritual garment for relationships to our self, our spouse, our children, our colleagues, our community, our planet, our life and our God. Couldn&#x2019;t all of us improve on at least ONE of these relationships? <p>Dr. Kaplan&#x2019;s approach to understanding our astrological life chart teaches us how to find our purpose and place through the exploration and interpretation of our dreams. </p><p>The Invisible Garment teaches us to: <br>� Look at "what's right with you" rather than "what's wrong with you." <br>� Liberate yourself to wear YOUR specific garment rather than trying to meet the expectations of others. <br>� Understand how you are always supported by an undergarment of simple underlying spiritual principles. <br>� Remind yourself of your divine nature. <br>� Avoid falling in love with what you think you SHOULD be doing. <br>� Dodge the rut of figuring out what to DO before you know what you came here to BE. <br>� Stop overanalyzing your "shoulds." <br>� Forget wishing for things to be "tidy"&#x2014;randomness and chaos breed possibility!</p></p><p>Dr. Connie Kaplan, who holds Master&#x2019;s degrees in Communications and Psychology and a Doctorate of Ministry, is the author of The Woman&#x2019;s Book of Dreams (Beyond Words, 1999) and Dreams are Letters from the Soul (Random House/Harmony, 2002). Acclaimed as manifestos for dreamers, these books have made Kaplan instrumental in the rapidly growing international phenomenon, dream circles. Called the "red tents" of the twenty-first century, dream circles are intimate gatherings where dreamers come together, listen deeply to one another&#x2019;s dreams, and unveil the spiritual wisdom encoded therein. <p>For 13 years in talks and seminars across the country, Kaplan has revolutionized traditional views of dreaming by teaching that dreams are a hotline to deep spiritual connection.

In <i>The Other Paris</i>, Luc Sante gives us a panoramic view of that second metropolis, which has nearly vanished but whose traces are in the bricks and stones of the contemporary city, in the culture of France itself, and, by extension, throughout the world.</p><p>Drawing on testimony from a great range of witnesses, Sante, whose thorough research is matched only by the vividness of his narration, takes the reader on a whirlwind tour. Richly illustrated with more than three hundred images, <i>The Other Paris </i>scuttles through the knotted pre-Haussmann streets, through the improvised accommodations of the original bohemians, through the whorehouses and dance halls and hobo shelters of the old city.</p><p>A lively survey of labor conditions, prostitution, drinking, crime, and popular entertainment, and of the reporters, <i>r�aliste </i>singers, pamphleteers, and poets who chronicled their evolution, <i>The Other Paris </i>is a book meant to upend the story of the French capital, to reclaim the city from the bons vivants and the speculators, and to hold a light to the work and lives of those expunged from its center by the forces of profit.</p></p><p><b>Luc Sante</b> was born in Verviers, Belgium.

Thank you, Luc Sante.&#x201d; &#x2015;Paul Auster</p><p>&#x201c;Nowadays, the old crowded, swarming, surly cities are at least half-forgotten. But in this great chronicle Luc Sante recalls when Paris was rougher, when the poor, the tough, the unregulated, the underworld, thrived there; maybe the city was also less rough, in that there was room for nearly everyone all the way down the social ladder. Hanging over <i>The Other Paris</i> is the contemporary curse of cities that perhaps hit Paris first, of cities that have become bland transnational stopping places for the privileged. Magisterial as ever, Sante returns us to the flavor, texture, savor, shouts, and clashes of the bygone city.&#x201d; &#x2015;Rebecca Solnit</p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Other Paris</i> is a heartbreaking spectacle, immense in intellectual and political scope and emotional reach. Peopled by crooks and movie stars, gamblers and thinkers, the world's premier city of dreams is rendered, through Luc Sante's fine hand, historian's eye, and poet's heart, into a place we hardly knew-a world of hitherto unknown mysteries and realities.

A suspenseful and always surprising romp through 1911 Egypt with Amelia and her equally indomitable family, the Emersons, <i>The Falcon at the Portal</i> immerses us in a fascinating world of antiquity and majesty, and plunges us into a mystery as perilous as it is puzzling. As the <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> suggests, let us all &#x201c;raise a toast to the incomparable Amelia Peabody.&#x201d;</p></p><p>"'Really,' I thought in mounting exasperation, 'there never was a household in which so many people felt free to offer their unsolicited opinions!'" This, of course, is the eminent Egyptologist and dedicated crime solver Amelia Peabody, setting the stage and the tone (an updated Oscar Wildean irony) for Elizabeth Peters's 11th book. And it's true that there are no shrinking violets in this particular household, from the redoubtable Amelia and her hot-tempered archaeologist husband Emerson (his native diggers call him the Father of Curses), to their dashing, unpredictable son Ramses (born Walter). Also, let's not forget their lovely ward, Nefret (rescued from a desert tribe several books back), and their butler, Gargery, "who wields a cudgel as handily as he carves a roast." <p> As she has so many times before, Peters presents us with this quaint--even campy--little group of people, plops them down in an exotic Egyptian setting, and then surprises us by involving them in a story of great strength and emotion. </p><p> It's 1911, and David Todros, a young Egyptian who has just married into the Peabody family, is suspected of dealing in forged antiquities, possibly to help support a rising nationalist movement. Amelia, Emerson, Ramses, and Nefret all take various actions to help David, and there are serious, dangerous consequences for everyone involved. Despite the melodramatic setting and the theatrical language, Peters's story is--as always--modern, believable, and exciting.</p><p> Other books in the Peabody series available in paperback are <i>The Ape Who Guards the Balance</i>, <i>The Crocodile on the Sandbank</i>, <i>The Curse of the Pharaohs</i>, and <i>The Hippopotamus Pool</i>. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p><p>The Land of the Pharaohs harbors more secrets than any tomb can hide.</p><p>In Egypt for the 1911 archaeological season, Amelia Peabody and her family are not anticipating trouble, but it finds them nonetheless. Their young friend David is accused of selling ancient artifacts, and it's up to the Emersons to expose the real culprit. But the body of an American discovered at the bottom of their excavation shaft and a child of mysterious antecedents are sparking twin crises that threaten to tear the family apart. Amelia brings her estimable powers of deduction to bear, but she might not survive long enough to unravel more than one perplexing puzzle&#x2014;because suddenly someone is shooting bullets in her direction . . . and coming too close for comfort!</p></p><h2>The Flower Fix: Modern arrangements for a daily dose of nature (Volume 2) (Fix Series, 2)</h2><p><b><i>The Flower Fix</i> presents wild inspiration and modern arrangements by Swallows and Damsons florist Anna Potter, with beautiful photography by India Hobson.</b><br><br> Blousy blooms, speckled branches, rich foliage, and delicate petals; nature has the power to inspire and energize, calm and soothe, focus and still.

Christopher Ketcham argues that the Church should make Charlie a saint, partly because <i>It&#x2019;s Always Sunny</i> is all about free will.&#x201d; Russ Hamer shows how closely the gang&#x2019;s activities comply with the scientific method. Kyle Alkema and Adam Barkman analyze the way the gang perceives happiness and how they try to get it. Charlotte Knowles considers whether Heidegger would consider members of the gang authentic or inauthentic and concludes that they&#x2019;re a bit of both. Skyler King examines the morality of the gang&#x2019;s behavior by the standard of how they respond to extreme suffering. Ethan Chambers agrees that each of the five central characters is a terrible person, but argues that they are not truly to blame for their actions. Fenner Tanswell demonstrates that many of the gang&#x2019;s wrong actions result not from immoral motives but from illogical thinking.

Over the course of a single night, in a narrative that unfolds hour by hour, he meets a cast of strange characters&#x2014;disgruntled workers at a Communist cafeteria, lecherous old men, sexually exploited women, pesky authors&#x2014;who eventually convince him to cast off his bourgeois aspirations for upward mobility and become a radical activist. Absurdist, inventive, and suffused with revolutionary fervor, and culminating in a dramatic face-off against capitalist power in the figure of the greedy businessman Mr. System, <i>The Hanging on Union Square</i> is a work of blazing wit and originality. More than eighty years after it was self-published, having been rejected by dozens of baffled publishers, it has become a classic of Asian American literature&#x2014;a satirical send-up of class politics and capitalism and a shout of populist rage that still resonates today.<br><br><b>Celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month with these three Penguin Classics:</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>America Is in the Heart </i>by Carlos Bulosan (9780143134039)<br> <i>East Goes West </i>by Younghill Kang (9780143134305)<br> <i>The Hanging on Union Square </i>by H.

"Comrade" this. "Comrade" that. To people in the Communist Cafeteria, Mr. Nut wasn't "Mister" anymore. It did not please him; for how could they take for granted so much that he was their "comrade"--a Communist?<br><br>Sometimes they called Mr. Nut "Fellow-Worker". That made him madder still. How could they know that he was a worker? Did they not see that he had a black derby on! Yes, he was a worker. Now. For the time being! But how could they tell that he would not, someday, by saving some money, establish a business of his own?</p><p>In the Communist Cafeteria, there were so many literature agents, so many pamphlet-salesmen and so many contribution-seekers. One after the other.<br><br>If a panhandler came to you, all you needed was to show him your face-he would go away. No argument. But these agents, salesmen and contribution-seekers gave you more trouble than panhandlers. Why? Because, they said, they themselves would get nothing out of it. Every cent would go to the cause. Was it true? Yes. It was true. For all these sealed tin-boxes with coin-spaces at the tops and the contribution-lists were their spokesmen. Besides, they wouldn't ask you to buy or to contribute right away. They just sat at your table and made friends with you. And explained things to you. A few seconds or a minute later, the boxes, the pamphlet and the contribution-list appeared from some unseen source.<br><br>With your hand, you said, "I won't give." But your conscience said, "I must do my share." And you lost money.</p><p>On the wall there was a sign: "Don't shout so loud, your comrade can hear you!" Mr. Nut thought: "If the Communists don't shout, how can they make a revolution?"</p><p>Again, he saw on the wall many figures, painted on cardboard; figures with overalls on. Shirt-sleeves rolled up. Chests bare. Black hair could be seen. Caps incorrectly placed. Shoes out of shape. Yes, these figures looked like him when he was working. But he did not understand why the fellow who made those posters could not do the worker a favor by giving him a necktie, a coat, pressed trousers, a nice, soft, felt hat or a derby. It needn�t have cost him more than a few strokes.</p><p>About six o'clock, the floor-manager, moving from one table to another, was propagandizing: "This is no private business. This is your restaurant." (Does that mean that Nut will not have to pay for all he ate?) "After you eat, don't hang around. Give your seats to others. We're not capitalists. We can't afford to lose money. Comrades!" (Again Comrade.) "Fellow-workers!" (Again Fellow-worker).<br><br>If the so-called "comrade'" floor-manager had had a butcher face, Mr. Nut would have had a chance to show his anger. But the so-called "comrade" was smiling. What could Mr. Nut do? The point was, however, that while Mr. Nut came here to get some Communistic atmosphere, although two hours had elapsed, he hadn't seen the whole thing yet. But Mr. Nut had to move.</p><p>As to one thing he felt he had been educated.</p><p>While he was conversing with a young fellow in the cafeteria, Nut interrogated him with: "How's business?" Upon hearing this, the color of the young fellow�s face suddenly changed and his eyebrows rose. The dark spots of his eyes became steady and because of the steadiness it made the surrounding white parts appear smaller. Mr. Nut knew that the young fellow was angry. But Mr. Nut didn't know why.<br><br>The young fellow saw that that Mr. Nut was shooting back with a steady face, too, and he became more angry. Because of his doubled anger, the young fellow pointed to Mr. Nut saying: "You are a Mister! You are a Boss! You are a Capitalist!" and "You are a Business Man!"<br><br>Now Mr. Nut stood up and shouted with joy. For it was the first time in his life that there was a person who didn't call him "Nut" and gave him instead such respectable titles as "Boss," "Business Man" and even "Capitalist".<br><br>He held the pointing fingers of the outstretched hand of the young fellow warmly and tightly and said to him: "You know me better than my father and mother when they were alive, and you are my friend-my best friend. You know that I am not a Nut. I will have my day. In return, I, too, wish you success and that you will make lots of money."<br><br>The young fellow having heard all that Mr. Nut said to him, every word, didn't like it. But the young fellow understood that Mr. Nut was not sarcastic or sneering, nor had any bad feeling; for the young fellow saw his face blank, his eyes sincere, his forehead perspiring. And he felt his hand warm and heard his breath short.<br><br>Then the young fellow replied with the same sincerity and said: "Please call me 'Thief', 'Robber,' and all kinds of other names, but not 'Business Man' or 'Capitalist'. I am a League member; I am a young Communist!"<br><br>Mr. Nut didn't know what that was all about. But Mr. Nut did know that Communists do not like the daily compliment: "How is business!"</p><p>Then he heard a girl call out to that young fellow, �We have to be at the meeting earlier. So the boys can not say we girls are inferior. Comrade Stubborn: Hurry up.� Nut now understood that that young fellow was not a fellow but a girl. A girl in a certain kind of uniform. He suddenly felt that this talking, finger-holding, eye-to-eye-looking and all this sorrow, joy, sentiment and emotion should not have been expressed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>III:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With A Temperament&nbsp;Of This Sort</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"A ten-cent check<br>I had my coffee an'<br>I have only a nickel<br>In my hand."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reason Nut was called Nut was very interesting.</p><p>Once Mr. Nut shaved all the hair off his head. Some say he did it for the sake of a sun-bath. Since other parts of the body needed a sun-bath there was no reason why this part of the body shouldn't need one.</p><p>Some say Mr. Nut shaved all the hair off his head because he knew that he had no money now. But he did believe that some day he would have money like other bald-headed millionaires walking with pretty movie-stars along Park Avenue. But he would not have his head bald then. It would be too awkward. In order to avoid awkwardness in the future, he did the prevention-work early. The more you shaved your hair, the stronger it would become. It was the same with the hair as with the beard.</p><p>Some say he shaved all the hair off his head because his friend Mr. Wiseguy once cut off some while he was napping. He had all his hair shaved off as a form of protest-passive resistance.</p><p>Some say he shaved all the hair off his head because so many girls liked him. So many girls liked him so much, his hair was souvenired off.</p><p>No matter what the reason may have been, when his hair was shaved off and his head became nut-like, he won the title "Nut."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many millionaires are Nut-headed. Yet they are not Nut-named. As far as Mr. Nut was concerned, there were other stories involved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once he was standing at the corner of Fourteenth Street and Union Square. A bus was passing by. A girl in the rear seat waved her hand at him. She smiled too. When he began to wave his hand and smile, the bus began to move. He moved too. But the bus had four wheels. He had only two.</p><p>Every day after work, he came to the same spot, waiting. Yes, there were some girls in the bus. Yes, they were smiling. Yes, a few of them were waving their hands, too. But they had nothing to do with him. Yes, sometimes some of them were waving their hands and smiling at him too. But none of them was the girl he had seen. He wanted to ask the conductor, but he didn't know how. At last he described the situation to the conductor. The conductor told him to go to the Nut House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the cafeteria, nobody stopped you from looking at the girls. Some fellows had the ability of moving only their eyeballs. They could see what they wanted to see without being noticed. But the muscles of Mr. Nut's eyes were not well developed. He had to move his head. He had to move the trunk of his body. Others moved their heads and trunks too. But they had the ability to generalize. They had the whole picture in a glance and digested it later. So these fellows did not take much time. But Mr. Nut was too scientific. And after these scientific studies, or, you may say, these artistic appreciations, Mr. Nut had a critical opinion. And in addition to the critical opinion, he had his constructive suggestion. It is said that once he suggested to a young girl that the seams of her stockings were not properly placed along the back of her legs. The reward was: "Mind your own business, Nut!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once in a cafeteria, Mr. Wiseguy spoke about his Four F theory regarding the technique of handling a woman. Others, hearing his theory, laughed and laughed to show their approval and appreciation. But to Mr. Nut it was as hard as the theory of relativity.<br><br>He asked what the theory of the Four F's was about.<br><br>Mr. Wiseguy told him that the first F was "To Find."<br><br>Mr. Nut would have liked to know where; but Mr. Wiseguy proceeded with his second F: "To Fool." Mr. Nut was surprised that one person had to fool the other. The others exclaimed unanimously, "That is the way it ought to be."<br><br>Mr. Nut asked about the third F. Mr. Wiseguy turned his head around and suddenly stopped-because a few girls sat behind. Mr. Nut asked again. Mr. Wiseguy said the fourth F was "To Forget."<br><br>Nut said: "How can I forget, when you haven't told me the third F yet?" Mr. Wiseguy raised a fork and said in anger: "You understand? Nut!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once he moved from uptown along Forty-second Street to the downtown section. He didn't take a taxi, for it would have cost him one dollar. He took the subway. Bundle after bundle-it took him about fifteen trips to get the work done. Five cents to go down and five cents to come up. So one round-trip cost him ten cents and fifteen trips cost him a dollar-fifty. Still he was pleased. His theory was that a taxi was for a rich man and the subway was for a poor man.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next day his friend gave him a bed. He knew that this time he could not stick to his previous theory. He called a taxi from uptown Bronx to downtown. That cost him three dollars. And he saw a sign on the window of a neighborhood second-hand furniture store showing the price of the same bed was only one dollar and fifty cents. <br><br>The first few nights Mr. Nut was pleased, however, that he slept on a &#x201c;something-for-nothing&#x201d; bed. But gradually he became Nut-conscious. How could you say that a dollar and a half extra wasn&#x2019;t Nut money? And no wonder others called him Nut. He would also call himself a Nut. The more he thought of it, the more Nut-conscious he became. The more Nut-conscious he became, the harder it was for him to sleep. He turned around, from one side to the other. He could not sleep. <br><br>Next day he got up early. He looked at the bed. It was the same bed that he could get for a dollar and fifty cents at his neighborhood store. The more he looked at the bed the madder he became. And then, the question was not a matter of a dollar and fifty cents.

Long passionate about the Civil War buff, she has studied theera avidly and has&nbsp;made many visits to Gettysburg,&nbsp; where she has witnessedreenactments of the legendary clash between North and South. Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i>Cheryl's relatively small backyard was festooned with streamers and balloons and crowded with yelling kids. Portable tables sagged under custom-made cakes and piles of brightly wrapped presents, while two clowns and a slightly ratty Cinderella mingled with miniature guests, all of them sugar-jazzed. Austin's childhood pony, Bamboozle, trucked in from the Silver Spur especially for the birthday party, provided rides with saintlike equanimity.<br><br>Keeping one eye on the horse and the other on his daughters, six years old as of 7:52 that sunny June morning, Tate counted himself a lucky man, for all the rocky roads he'd traveled. Born almost two months before full term, the babies had weighed less than six pounds put together, and their survival had been by no means a sure thing. Although the twins were fraternal, they looked so much alike that strangers usually thought they were identical. Both had the striking blue eyes that ran in the McKettrick bloodline, and their long glossy hair was nearly black, like Cheryl's and his own. His girls were healthy now, thank God, but Tate still worried plenty about them, on general principle. They seemed so fragile to him, too thin, with their long, skinny legs, and Ava wore glasses and a hearing aid that was all but invisible.<br><br>Cheryl startled Tate out of his reflections by jabbing him in the ribs with a clipboard. Today, her waist-length hair was wound into a braided knot at the back of her neck. "Sign this," she ordered, sotto voce.<br><br>Tate had promised himself he'd be civil to his ex-wife, for the twins' sake. Looking down into Cheryl's green eyes&#x2014;she'd been a beauty queen in her day&#x2014;he wondered what he'd been drinking the night they met.<br><br>Gorgeous as Cheryl was, she flat-out wasn't his type, and she never had been.<br><br>He glanced at the paper affixed to the clipboard and frowned, then gave all the legalese a second look. It was basically a permission slip, allowing Audrey and Ava to participate in something called the Pixie Pageant, to be held around the time school started, out at the Blue River Country Club. Under the terms of their custody agreement, Cheryl needed his approval for any extracurricular activity the children took part in. It had cost him plenty to get her to sign off on that one.<br><br>"No," he said succinctly, tucking the clipboard under one arm, since Cheryl didn't look like she intended to take it back.<br><br>The former Mrs. McKettrick, once again using her maiden name, Darbrey, rolled her eyes, patted her sleek and elegant hair. "Oh, for God's sake," she complained, though he had to give her points for keeping her voice down. "It's just a harmless little pageant, to raise money for the new tennis court at the community center&#x2014;"<br><br>Tate's mind flashed on the disturbing film clips he'd seen of kids dolled up in false eyelashes, blusher and lipstick, like Las Vegas showgirls, prancing around some stage. He leaned in, matching his tone to hers. "They're <em>six,</em> Cheryl," he reminded her. "Let them be little girls while they can."<br><br>His former wife folded her tanned, gym-toned arms. She looked good in her expensive daffodil-yellow sundress, but the mean glint in her eyes spoiled the effect. "I was in pageants from the time I was five," she pointed out tersely, "and I turned out okay." Realizing too late that she'd opened an emotional pothole and then stepped right into it, she made a slight huffing sound.<br><br>"Debatable," Tate drawled, plastering a smile onto his mouth because some of the moms and nannies were looking in their direction, and they'd stirred up enough gossip as it was.<br><br>Cheryl flushed, toyed with one tasteful gold earring. "Bastard," she whispered, peevish. "Why do you have to be so damn pigheaded about things like this?"<br><br>He laughed. Hooked his thumbs through the belt loops of his jeans. Dug in his heels a little&#x2014;both literally and figuratively. "If other people want to let their kids play Miss This-That-and-the-Other-Thing, that's their business. It's probably harmless fun, but <em>mine</em> aren't going to&#x2014;not before they're old enough to make the choice on their own, anyhow. By that time, I hope Audrey and Ava will have more in their heads than makeup tips and the cosmetic uses of duct tape."<br><br>Eyes flashing, Cheryl looked as though she wanted to put out both hands and shove him backward into the koi pond&#x2014;or jerk the clipboard from under his arm and bash him over the head with it. She did neither of those things&#x2014;she didn't want a scene any more than he did, though her reasons were different. Tate cared about one thing and one thing only: that his daughters had a good time at their birthday party. Cheryl, on the other hand, knew a public dustup would make the rounds of the country club and the Junior League before sundown.<br><br>She had her image to consider.<br><br>Tate, by contrast, didn't give a rat's ass what anybody thought&#x2014;except for his daughters, that is, and a few close friends.<br><br>So they glared at each other, he and this woman he'd married years ago, squaring off like two gunfighters on a dusty street. And then Ava slipped between them.<br><br>"Don't fight, okay?" she pleaded anxiously, the hot Texas sunlight glinting on the smudged lenses of her glasses. "It's our <em>birthday,</em> remember?"<br><br>Tate felt his neck pulse with the singular heat of shame. So much for keeping the ongoing hostilities between Mommy and Daddy under wraps.<br><br>Cheryl smiled wickedly and rested a manicured hand on Ava's shoulder, left all but bare by the spaghetti strap holding up her dress&#x2014;a miniature version of her mother's outfit. Audrey's getup was the same, except blue.<br><br>"Your daddy," Cheryl told the child sweetly, "doesn't want you and Audrey to compete in the Pixie Pageant. I was trying to change his mind."<br><br><em>Good luck with that,</em> Tate thought, forcibly relaxing the muscles in his jaws. He tried for a smile, for Ava's sake, but the effort was a bust.<br><br>"That stuff is dumb anyway," Ava said.<br><br>Audrey appeared on the scene, as though magnetized by an opinion at variance with her own. "No, it <em>isn't,"</em> she protested, with her customary spirit. "Pageants are good for building self-confidence and making friends, and if you win, you get a banner and a trophy <em>and</em> a tiara."<br><br>"I see you've been coaching them to take the party line," Tate told Cheryl.<br><br>Cheryl's smile was dazzling. He'd spent a fortune on those pearly whites of hers. Through them, she said, "Shut up, Tate."<br><br>Ava, always sensitive to the changing moods of the parental units, started to cry, making a soft, sniffly sound that tore at Tate's heart. "We're only going to be six <em>once,"</em> she said. "And everybody's looking!"<br><br>"Thank heaven we're only going to be six once," Audrey interjected sagely, folding her arms Cheryl-style.<br><br>"I'd rather be forty."<br><br>Tate bent his knees, scooped up Ava in the crook of one arm and tugged lightly at Audrey's long braid with his free hand. Ava buried her face in his shoulder, bumping her glasses askew. He felt tears and mucus moisten the fabric of his pale blue shirt.<br><br>"Forty?" she said, voice muffled. "Even <em>Daddy</em> isn't that old!"<br><br>"You're such a baby," Audrey replied.<br><br>"Enough," Tate told both children, but he was looking at Cheryl as he spoke. "When is this shindig supposed to be over?"<br><br>They'd opened presents, devoured everything but the cakes and competed for prizes a person would expect to see on a TV game show. What else was there to do?<br><br>"Why can't you just stop fighting?" Ava blurted.<br><br>"We're <em>not</em> fighting, darling," Cheryl pointed out quietly, before turning to sweep her watchful friends and the nannies up in a benign smile. "And stop carrying on, Ava. It isn't becoming&#x2014;or ladylike."<br><br>"Can we go out to the ranch, Daddy?" Ava asked him plaintively, ignoring her mother's comment. "I like it better there, because nobody fights."<br><br>"Me, too," Tate agreed. It was his turn to take the kids, and he'd been looking forward to it since their last visit. Giving them back was always a wrench.<br><br>"Nobody fights at the ranch?" Audrey argued, sounding way too bored and way too sophisticated for a six-year-old. Yeah, she was a prime candidate for the Pixie Pageant, all right, Tate thought bitterly&#x2014;bring on the mascara and enough hairspray to rip a new hole in the ozone layer, and don't forget the feather boas and the fishnet stockings.<br><br>Audrey drew a breath and went right on talking. "I guess you don't remember the day Uncle Austin came home from the hospital after that bull hurt him so bad, before he started rehab in Dallas, and how he told Daddy and Uncle Garrett to stay out of his part of the house unless they wanted a belly full of buckshot."<br><br>Cheryl arched one eyebrow, triumphant. For all their land, cattle, oil shares and cold, hard cash, the Mc-Kettricks were just a bunch of Texas rednecks, as far as she was concerned. She'd grown up in a Park Avenue high-rise, a cherished only child, after all, her mother an heiress to a legendary but rapidly dwindling fortune, her father a famous novelist, of the literary variety.<br><br>But, please, nobody mention that dear old Mom snorted coke and would sleep with anything in pants, and Dad ran through the last of his wife's money and then his surprisingly modest earnings as the new Ernest Hemingway.<br><br>Cheryl had never gotten over the humiliation of having to wait tables and take out student loans to put herself through college and law school.<br><br>"I wonder what my attorney would say," Cheryl intoned, "if I told him the children are exposed to <em>guns,</em> out there on the wild and wooly Silver Spur."<br><br>While Tate couldn't argue that there weren't firearms on the ranch&#x2014;between the snakes and all the other dangers inherent to the land, firepower might well prove to be a necessity at any time&#x2014;it was a stretch to say the girls were "exposed" to them. Every weapon was locked up in one of several safes, and the combinations changed regularly.<br><br>"I wonder what <em>mine</em> would say," Tate retorted evenly, the fake smile aching on his face, "if he knew about your plans for this week."<br><br>"Stop," Ava begged.<br><br>Tate sighed, kissed his daughter smartly on the forehead, and set her on her feet again. "Sorry, sweetheart," he said. "Say goodbye and thanks to your friends. The party's over."<br><br>"They haven't even sung the song I taught them," Cheryl said.<br><br>Ava leaned against Tate's hip. "We're not good singers at all," she confided.<br><br>Somewhat to Tate's surprise, it was Audrey, the performer in the family, who turned on one sandaled heel, faced the assemblage and announced cheerfully, "You can all go home now&#x2014;my dad says the party's over."<br><br>Cheryl winced.<br><br>The kids&#x2014;and the pony&#x2014;seemed relieved. So did the nannies, though the proper term, according to Cheryl, was <em>au pairs.</em> The mothers, many of whom Tate had known since kindergarten and dated in high school between all-too-frequent breakups with Libby Remington, the great love of his youth, if not his entire life, hid bitchy little smiles with varying degrees of success.<br><br>"The girls are a little tired," Cheryl explained, with convincing sincerity. "All this excitement&#x2014;"<br><br>"Can we ride horses when we get to the ranch?" Audrey called, from halfway across the yard. "Can we swim in the pool?"<br><br>Tate made damn sure he didn't smile at this indication of how "tired" his daughters were, but it was hard.<br><br>Ava remained at his side, both arms clenched around his waist now.<br><br>"Their suitcases," Cheryl said tightly, "are in the hall."<br><br>"Let's load Bamboozle in the trailer," Tate told Ava, gently easing out of her embrace. "Then we'll get your stuff and head for the ranch."<br><br>Ava peeled herself away from Tate, walked over and took Bamboozle by the bridle strap, patiently waiting to lead the elderly animal to the trailer hitched to the back of Tate's truck. Audrey had disappeared into the house, on some mission all her own.<br><br>"Don't help," Cheryl snapped, out of one side of her mouth. "You've already done enough, Tate McKettrick."<br><br>"I live to delight you in every possible way, Cheryl."<br><br>Audrey poked her head out between the French doors standing a little ajar between the living room and the patio. "Can we stop at the Perk Up on the way out of town, Dad?" she wanted to know, as calmly as if the backyard weren't full of dismissed guests. "Get some of those orange smoothie things, like before?"<br><br>Tate grinned. "Sure," he told his daughter, even though the thought of stopping at Libby's coffee shop made the pit of his stomach tighten. He'd only gone in there the last time because he'd known Libby was out of town, and her sister, Julie, was running the show.<br><br>Which was ridiculous. They'd managed to avoid each other for years now, no mean trick in such a small town, but it was getting to be too damn much work.<br><br>"Just what they need&#x2014;more sugar," Cheryl muttered, shaking her head as she walked away, her arms still crossed in front of her chest, only more tightly now.<br><br>Tate held his tongue. <em>He</em> hadn't been the one to serve cake and ice cream and fruit punch by the wheelbarrow load all afternoon.<br><br>Cheryl kept walking.<br><br>Tate and Ava led the pony into the horse trailer, which, along with his truck, took up at least three parking spaces on the shady street in front of Cheryl's house. He'd bought the place for her as a part&#x2014;a <em>small</em> part&#x2014;of their divorce settlement.<br><br>"Boozle might get lonely riding in this big trailer all by himself," Ava fretted, standing beside the pony while he slurped up water from a bucket. "Maybe I should ride back here with him, so he'd have some company."<br><br>"Not a chance," Tate said affably, dumping a flake of hay into the feeder for the pony to munch on, going home. "Too dangerous."<br><br>Ava adjusted her glasses. "Audrey really wants to be in that Pixie Pageant," she said, her voice small. "She's going to nag you three ways from Sunday about it, too."<br><br>Tate bit back a grin. "I think I can handle a little nagging," he said lightly. "Let's go get your stuff and hit the road, Shortstop."<br><br>"I probably wouldn't win anyway," Ava mused wistfully, stopping her father cold.<br><br>"Win what?" Tate asked.<br><br>Ava giggled, but it was a strained sound, like she was forcing it. "The <em>Pixie Pageant,</em> Dad. Keep up, will you?"<br><br>Tate's throat went tight, but he managed a chuckle. "Sure, you'd win," he said. "And that's another reason I won't let you enter in the first place. Just think how bad all those other little girls would feel."<br><br>"Audrey could be Miss Pixie," Ava speculated thoughtfully, a small, light-rimmed shadow standing there in the horse trailer. "She can twirl a baton and everything. I keep on dropping mine."<br><br>"Audrey isn't entering," Tate said. Bamboozle was between them; he removed the pony's saddle and blanket, ran a hand along his sweaty back. "She'll just have to content herself with being Miss <em>McKettrick,</em> at least for the foreseeable future."<br><br>Ava mulled that over for a few moments, chewing her lower lip. "Do you think I'll be pretty when I grow up, Dad?"<br><br>Tate moved to the back of the trailer, jumped down, turned and held out his arms for Ava, even though she could have walked down the ramp. "No," he said, as she came within reach. "I think you'll be beautiful, like you are right now."<br><br>Ava felt featherlight as he swung her to the ground, and it gave him a pang. Was it his fault that the girls had been born too soon? Was there something he could have done to prevent all the struggles they'd faced just getting through infancy?<br><br>"You're only saying that because you're my dad."<br></p><h2>Rescue on Nim&#39;s Island (3)</h2><p><b>In her third gripping adventure, Nim unearths an amazing opalized fossil, but this discovery puts her island in terrible danger</b><br><br>Nim lives on an island with her father, Jack, a marine iguana called Fred, a sea lion called Selkie, and their friend Alex Rover, the adventure writer.

So Lila sets off, ready to face anything that gets in her way. An ALA Booklist Editors&#39; Choice. Illustrations.</p><p><blockquote> <i>"A thousand miles ago, in a country east of the jungle and south of the mountains, there lived a firework-maker called Lalchand and his daughter, Lila."</i> </blockquote><p> Lila, the heroine of Philip Pullman's charming fable, was, as a baby, "a cross little thing, always crying and refusing her food, but Lalchand built a cradle for her in the corner of the workshop, where she could see the sparks play and listen to the fizz and crackle of the gunpowder." Once out of her cradle, she showed a marked talent for pyrotechnics, even inventing her own fireworks with names like Tumbling Demons and Shimmering Coins. Nevertheless, when Lila tells her father she'd like to become a master firework-maker, he's shocked. Firework-making is no job for a girl, he tells her; besides, with her burned fingers and singed eyebrows, he's afraid he'll never be able to find a husband for her.</p><p> If Lalchand is horrified by Lila's ambitions, his daughter is equally appalled by the prospect of a husband. Instead, she decides to run away to Mount Merapi, where every firework-maker must go to claim some of the royal sulphur from Razvani the Fire-Fiend. Lila's adventures on the road to Merapi alternate with those of her best friend, Chulak, and his talking white elephant, Hamlet, who set out after her when they learn something that could mean life or death for Lila. Along the way, they meet pirates, wild animals, and supernatural beings of every stripe until, at last, Lila must face the scariest obstacle of all: her own fear. Pullman invests <i>The Firework-Maker's Daughter</i> with wit, wonder, and more than a few goose bumps. The charm of the prose is reflected in the black and white illustrations by S. Saelig Gallagher that punctuate this slim novel. Though not as sophisticated as Pullman's remarkable fantasy novels <i>The Golden Compass</i> and <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, this engaging story <i>does</i> share a courageous heroine, an exciting adventure, and a singular philosophy that ties everything together in a deeply satisfying denouement. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Lila has learned from her father almost all there is to know about making fireworks. But he's held back the final secret, the most dangerous one. With the help of her friend Chulak, Lila discovers the secret -- that anyone who wants to be a true firework-maker must face down the Fire-Fiend of Mount Merapi and bring back some of the royal sulphur. So Lila sets off, ready to face anything that gets in her way.<p>It is only after Lila has gone that Chulak discovers the other half of the secret -- that Lila needs a flask of magic water from the Goddess of Emerald Lake or she will perish in the flames. So Chulak and Hamlet, the talking white elephant, set off to find Lila -- before it's too late....</p></p><h2>Intrigues: Book Two of the Collegium Chronicles (A Valdemar Novel) (Valdemar: Collegium Chronicles)</h2><p>Magpie is a thirteen-year-old orphan chosen by one of the magical Companion horses of Valdemar and taken to the capital city, Haven, to be trained as a Herald.

You probably bought cute new clothes to keep baby stylish and warm, and washed them in special laundry detergent to make sure they wouldn&#x2019;t irritate that new baby skin. You probably decorated a nursery and bought toys to stimulate baby&#x2019;s little growing brain. You also likely bought a car seat (and maybe even a family-size car&#x2014;hello, minivan!), high chair, and other equipment t make sure baby is always safe and secure. I remember spending hours reading reviews and safety information on products to ensure that my babies were going to be safe and that I was making the best decisions about which items to use for them. When your baby was first born, you probably made sure everyone washed their hands before touching your infant, and you told people who were sick to stay far, far away. You sterilized bottles and pacifiers. You breastfed baby or diligently prepared formula bottles. You did all of this, and much more, to keep baby safe and healthy.<br><br>As parents, we have gladly taken, and will continue to take, all precautions to ensure that our child is safe and healthy. But what if I told you that most of us don&#x2019;t really give much thought to one of the most important things that we can do to keep baby healthy now and throughout their life&#x2014;providing nutritious food?<br><br><b>When It&#x2019;s Time for Baby to Start Eating Solid Foods, What Should You Provide?</b><br><br>This might seem like a silly question to ponder. You feed babies baby food, right? It&#x2019;s fuel&#x2014;calories they need to grow bigger. Well, science has revealed that it isn&#x2019;t quite that simple. First, we all know that our food landscape has changed dramatically over the past 100 years. We have become a society with foods that are genetically modified, doused with fertilizers and insecticides, and highly processed. These changes in our food environment have been blamed for causing not only some cancers and obesity, but also other childhood disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and even autism (more on these topics in chapter 8).<br><br>Also, we have learned so much in recent years about how what we eat, especially at certain developmental periods in life, can not only influence behavior but also lead to lasting changes to the brain and body. New research exploring how food intake during early stages of life may impact a child&#x2019;s health and development has helped us to more seriously consider what we feed our babies in order to promote optimal health now and for the rest of their lives.<br><br> <b>You Are What You Eat </b><br><br>Most of the recent headline-grabbing research on early-life nutrition has focused on obesity. In the past 30 years, childhood obesity in the United States has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents. The percentage of U.S. children aged 6 to 11 years who are obese increased from 7 percent in 1980 to nearly 18 percent in 2012. In 2012, more than one third of children and adolescents were overweight or obese. While lack of exercise has been implicated as one contributing factor in this outcome, the bigger culprit is diet. Studies show that, on average, kids (like adults) eat more processed foods than unprocessed foods, and processed foods are high in added fats and sugars. This lifestyle can lead to habits that are hard to break and food preferences that become engrained into adulthood.<br><br>Obesity later on is certainly a concern when thinking about what foods to offer your baby, but there are many other reasons why what babies eat is important for their health. Every week there seems to be breaking news about some food additive or ingredient that has been linked to the development of food poisoning, food allergies, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and so on. Parents wonder, <i>Is this real or just media hype? Will my kid get cancer from the nitrates in the hot dog I fed him? Was there BPA in that can of soup I heated up for my toddler for lunch? Will my child be addicted to sugar because I bribed him with M&amp;M&#x2019;s to sit on the potty?</i> These are just a handful of the anxiety-provoking questions that parents have about food&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s not even&nbsp; considering the general challenge of just getting a baby to eat. This confusion in the media and lack of science-based advice was a major motivation for me to write this book. With mounting evidence of the need for good nutrition early in life, and with the questions and angst that can come with feeding an infant or toddler, it is essential that parents have a realistic, accessible, and hype-free resource to explain the new scientific findings in this area.<br><br>***</p><h2>Absolute Beginners (Allison &amp; Busby Classics)</h2><p>London, 1958. In the smoky jazz clubs of Soho and the coffee bars of Notting Hill the young and the restless - the absolute beginners - are forging a new carefree lifestyle of sex, drugs and rock&#39;n&#39;roll. Moving in the midst of this world of mods and rockers, Teddy gangs and trads., and snapping every scene with his trusty Rolleiflex, is MacInnes&#39; young photographer, whose unique wit and honest views remain the definitive account of London life in the 1950s and what it means to be a teenager. In this twentieth century cult classic, MacInnes captures the spirit of a generation and creates the style bible for anyone interested in Mod culture, and the changing face of London in the era of the first race riots and the lead up to the swinging Sixties...</p><p>A talented off-beat journalist and social observer, Colin MacInnes is best known for his trilogy of London novels which includes Absolute Beginners as well as City of Spades and Mr Love and Justice. He also wrote about the allied occupation of Germany in the aftermath of the Second World War, in June in Her Spring and England, Half English. He died of cancer in 1976. Since his death his best essays, fiction and journalism have been published in various collections."The writing is breathtaking. Every word carefully selected to draw you further and further in. Occasionally it becomes reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange with the teenagers having their own language and their own world, only half understood by the adults they hold in so much contempt...

It is refreshing to see a very practical book that is solidly grounded in Scripture. While being loaded with practical helps, it refrains from presenting a canned or stereotypical model of witness that everyone should follow. Instead, we see different ways of outreach, which individuals could adopt according to their differing personalities, gifts, and circumstances. This book is unique in being amazingly comprehensive, covering many issues that other books on witness miss out on. Clearly, it is the work of a practitioner.&#x201d; -- Ajith Fernando</p><h2>Blackwing (Raven&#39;s Mark)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A remarkably assured fantasy debut that mixes of the inventiveness of China Mi�ville with the fast paced heroics of David Gemmell.&#x201d;&#x2014;Anthony Ryan, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Legion of Flame</i><br><br>Set on a postapocalyptic frontier, <i>Blackwing</i> is a gritty fantasy debut about a man&#x2019;s desperate battle to survive his own dark destiny...</b><br> <b><br></b><i>Hope, reason, humanity: the Misery breaks them all.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Under its cracked and wailing sky, the Misery is a vast and blighted expanse, the arcane remnant of a devastating war with the immortals known as the Deep Kings.

The sympathisers left nothing behind but an empty apartment and a few volumes of illegal verse. A half-eaten meal, ransacked drawers. They&#x2019;d scrambled together what little they could carry and fled east into the Misery. Back when I wore a uniform, the marshal told me only three kinds of people willingly enter the Misery: the desperate, the stupid, and the greedy. The sympathisers were desperate enough. I gathered a dozen stupid, greedy men and set out to kill them.</p><p>We left Valengrad on an afternoon that stank of drains, regret, and the end of another bad summer. The money didn&#x2019;t justify the risk, but hunting men was what I did, and I didn&#x2019;t intend to allow our quarry to get far. Half the rabble I&#x2019;d raised hadn&#x2019;t been out in the Misery before; they were practically shitting themselves when we headed out through the city&#x2019;s narrow gate. Within a mile, they were asking about gillings and dulchers. Two miles out and one of them began to cry. My old-timers laughed, reminded him we&#x2019;d be back before dark.</p><p>Three days later the arseholes were somehow still ahead of us. Nobody was laughing anymore.</p><p>&#x201c;They made for Dust Gorge,&#x201d; Tnota said. He fiddled with the dials on his astrolabe, held it up to eye the distance between the moons. &#x201c;Told you they would. Didn&#x2019;t I tell you that, Captain?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like balls you did.&#x201d; He had. The footprints in the grit were proving him right.</p><p>&#x201c;I sure did.&#x201d; Tnota grinned at me, mustard-yellow teeth stark in his treacle-dark face. &#x201c;I remember. You came into the bar with the papers, and I said, &#x201c;I bet they make for the gorge.&#x201d; Figure that earns me an extra share.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Even if this job paid well enough for extra shares, you still wouldn&#x2019;t get one. And it doesn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Not my fault. I don&#x2019;t pick the jobs,&#x201d; Tnota said.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the first time you&#x2019;ve been right today. Now keep quiet and plot us a course.&#x201d;</p><p>Tnota raised the glass eyepiece towards skies the colour of a week-old bruise. Dirty golds, hints of green, torn purples and ugly blood browns merged together, an easel of ruptured fluids and broken capillaries. He counted on his fingers, traced an invisible line from one moon to the next. The cracks in the sky were quiet, barely a whisper passing through the banks of restless cloud.</p><p>Everything in the Misery is broken. Everything is wrong. The sooner we shot the bastards and were heading back west, the happier I would be.</p><p>We rode through banks of grit and sand, the rock black and red and drier than salt. Something rises up from the Misery. You can feel it all the while, like air, but it&#x2019;s your enemy rather than your friend. It soaks into you, gets in your gums until you can taste the poison. I just hoped it&#x2019;d be over soon.</p><p>Three days into the Misery, cutting south and east over black sands, we found the remains of their stolen horse. Whatever had torn its legs off, the sympathisers we were hunting had done the smart thing. They&#x2019;d left the horse to its fate and run. A temporary respite, since they couldn&#x2019;t outrun us now. I could read relief in the way the men sat in their saddles. We&#x2019;d have a pair of heads bagged and slung by sundown, be heading back towards what passes for civilisation along the border.</p><p>I took my flask from my coat and shook it. Not the first time I&#x2019;d done that. It remained as empty as it had been on the last three occasions. Since I was out of brandy, that meant we only had small beer to drink, and not a great deal of that. The Misery is dangerous for groups of heavily armed soldiers. That a pair of untrained, unprepared, and unarmed civilians had stayed alive and ahead of us for three days was enough to give me nerves. Another reason to get this over with as quickly as possible.</p><p>The sand wrote a trail clear to see. Ahead of us lay Dust Gorge, a narrow fissure in the earth. The gash cut through the landscape of shifting dunes, caustic sand and brittle stones. The lightning-bolt corridor mirrored one of the rents in the sky, the split in the earth a reflection of the damage in the heavens. One of the sky&#x2019;s cracks began its high, sonorous wailing, causing my troop of not-soldiers to reach for spirit-stones and amulets. Free company men might have grit but they also have more superstitions than a priest on festival day. They wanted out of the Misery as much as I did. It was making them jumpy, and jumpy soldiers make a mess of even simple work. A generous man might call my troop of cutthroats soldiers. Generous men are generally idiots.</p><p>&#x201c;Nenn, get up here,&#x201d; I called as we approached a slope that led down into the gloom. She was chewing blacksap, jaws working, teeth dark as tar. There is no more irritating sound this side of the hells. &#x201c;You have to chew that stuff?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All the ladies chew it.&#x201d; She shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;Just because some duchess has a mouth full of rotten teeth, it doesn&#x2019;t mean you have to imitate her sycophant friends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t blame me for fashion, Captain. Got to keep up appearances.&#x201d;</p><p>Why Nenn thought anyone would be looking at her teeth when she was one nose short of a face was as baffling as the trend. Chew, chew, chew. I knew from experience that telling her to stop would be as pointless as telling Tnota to keep it in his trousers.</p><p>I glared at her anyway.</p><p>&#x201c;You got work for me, Captain?&#x201d; Nenn asked. She paused, spat half a lump of blacksap into the sand.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going down. Just me and you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just the two of us?&#x201d; The wooden nose strapped to her face didn&#x2019;t wrinkle, but the skin between her eyes creased.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s only two of them, and they aren&#x2019;t even armed. You don&#x2019;t think we can handle it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not them I&#x2019;m afraid of,&#x201d; Nenn said. She spat the rest of the blacksap the other way. &#x201c;Might be anything in there. Might be skweams. Dulchers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Might be a big pot of gold too. But we&#x2019;re too far south for dulchers anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And for skweams?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just get your shit sorted. We&#x2019;re going down. We need both heads intact if we&#x2019;re going to get paid, and you know how the lads can get. Can&#x2019;t trust them not to get carried away; courts don&#x2019;t pay out if there&#x2019;s any way they can avoid it. Remember what happened at Snosk?&#x201d;</p><p>It was Nenn&#x2019;s turn to scowl.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. I remember.&#x201d; Snosk was a bad memory for all of us. Missing out on a full job&#x2019;s pay over a technicality doesn&#x2019;t sit right with anyone. To this day I&#x2019;d still have argued that you could just about make out a face if you arranged the pieces right.</p><p>&#x201c;Good. So get bright and ready up.&#x201d;</p><p>I dismounted. My legs were sore from the saddle, the ache in my lower back crackling in a way it wouldn&#x2019;t have ten years ago. Didn&#x2019;t spend enough time in the saddle anymore. Getting soft. Soft, not old, that&#x2019;s what I told myself. Tnota got down to help me ready up. He was even older than I was, and though I could trust him not to put a sword through anybody&#x2019;s face, that was only because he&#x2019;s about as useful in a fight as a wax helmet. More likely to injure himself than anyone else, and it was Nenn&#x2019;s brand of nasty I needed down there. Tnota checked over the straps on my half armour, primed my matchlock as I selected weapons from the arsenal on my saddle and belted them on. I strapped on a short-bladed cutlass and a long-bladed dagger. No room to swing anything longer than an arm down in the gorge. I&#x2019;d been down there before, a few years back. It didn&#x2019;t get very wide. More alley than valley.</p><p>Nenn looked suitably fierce in blackened steel. Tnota sparked up a flame and got our match-cords smoking, the firearms primed and ready to spit lead. Didn&#x2019;t plan to use them. A matchlock ball will make an awfully big mess of something, but like Nenn said, there might be skweams. Might be anything down in the dark guts of the soured earth.</p><p>The sooner we cut the sympathisers&#x2019; heads off and started back towards the city, the better.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s only three places you can climb out of the gorge,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You remember where the others are?&#x201d;</p><p>Tnota nodded. He pointed the other two out to me, one about a mile off, the other half a mile east of that.</p><p>&#x201c;Good. If we flush them out, ride them down and wait for us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Easy work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tnota&#x2019;s in charge,&#x201d; I hollered at my boys, and they almost looked like they were paying attention. How I&#x2019;d managed to pick up such worthless gutter rats I couldn&#x2019;t recall. Out of brandy, twenty miles into the Misery and a troop of vermin at my heels. Somewhere in my life, things had gone very, very wrong.</p><p>A slope of loose rock and ancient, fossilised tree roots led down into the crevice. Not easy to navigate when you have a weapon to carry and the walls are only seven feet apart. There wasn&#x2019;t a great deal of light, just enough to pick out some poor footing. It was hard to avoid kicking showers of grit down into the dark, but we kept quiet as we could. Dust Gorge was deep. Probably one of the reasons that the enemy liked to use it as a meeting point for their spies and sympathisers. Our patrols didn&#x2019;t often sweep this deep into the Misery, nearly out of the Range altogether, but if they did they wouldn&#x2019;t go poking around down in the dark. Even the officers had more sense than that.</p><p>The air possessed a dry cold, no moisture at all. Trees roots protruded from the rock around us. A thousand-year-old forest had stood here once, back before the Misery had come into being. Only the roots remained now, as dry and grey as old bones. There was no water in the Misery, and the occasional oily black pool helped nothing to grow.</p><p>&#x201c;I have a confession to make,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;You got religion all of a sudden?&#x201d; Nenn grunted.</p><p>&#x201c;Hardly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You wanted to get me alone in the dark?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unlikely.&#x201d; I picked my way around a boulder. I put too much weight against it, and it crumbled away like chalk. Nothing in the Misery lasts. &#x201c;The court are paying more than I said. Not a lot more, but enough that it got me thinking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You lied about the fee?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. I always lie about the fee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Arsehole.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. But anyway. Got me thinking maybe these targets are more than just sympathisers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Spies?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. What if she&#x2019;s a Bride?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There are no Brides in Valengrad,&#x201d; Nenn said, too quick for conviction. As we descended, the lattice of roots above blotted out both light and wind. Nenn blew on her match-cord, kept the tip red and smoking. The glow lit her face red as a devil&#x2019;s. The smell of burning slow match was comforting in the dark, like woodsmoke but bitter, acrid.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;d love us to believe that,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The citadel found one last year. A big one, near wide as a house. Burned the building down around her, claimed it was just a fire.&#x201d;</p><p>Nenn tried to snort. She&#x2019;d never lost the habit. Sounded odd without a real nose to hawk it back through.</p><p>&#x201c;Bullshit. It was just some fat old whore who pissed off the wrong officer. Squawks get funny when some lowborn doxy turns them down. He burned the brothel out of spite and made excuses.&#x201d;</p><p>Nenn would believe what she wanted to believe and not an ounce of truth more.</p><p>&#x201c;Regardless. If there&#x2019;s a Bride down here, I don&#x2019;t want any of the men near her. You know what can happen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What makes you think you can resist a Bride better than they can?&#x201d; Nenn asked. I lowered my voice. Sounds didn&#x2019;t carry far along the tangled walls of the gorge, but no harm in being careful.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. I just trust you to ignore me and blow her head off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thought you said not to spoil her face?&#x201d;</p><p>I gave her a serious look, entirely lost in the gloom.</p><p>&#x201c;If she&#x2019;s a Bride, blow her fucking head off. Got it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it, Captain Galharrow, sir, blow her fucking head off, sir Be a bloody shame though, all this work for nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Would be. Better than the alternative. If they&#x2019;re marked we&#x2019;ll get paid anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>I slipped on loose gravel and Nenn reached out to steady me. The stones rattled away down the narrow incline. We both froze. If they were still down here, we&#x2019;d need to be more careful. Talk was distracting. Time to shut up and get bright. There was a curl in the rock ahead, and I brought the butt of my matchlock up against my shoulder as I slipped around the corner. Just more gully. We crept on. Slow-match smoke trailed lazily behind me in the dead air. I hoped that the lack of breeze meant it wouldn&#x2019;t carry on ahead of us and warn her. The smell is unmistakable. If she was a Bride, our best chance lay in taking her by surprise.</p><p>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; Nenn whispered. &#x201c;Light.&#x201d;</p><p>The pale, artificial glow of phos light around the next bend. I crept forward, placing my feet against solid rock as daintily as a man of my size can manage. Should have paid more attention in my dancing lessons. Nenn moved more nimbly, something about her reminding me of the stray cats in the city, all lean tautness and hiss. She rounded the rock wall with her weapon raised.</p><p>I half expected her to give fire, but she paused and I swept around close behind. The gorge widened, not a lot, but fifteen feet feels like a good lot of space when you&#x2019;re cramped down in the earth. The sympathisers had made a little camp for themselves. They had a pile of worn old blankets next to some sticks they&#x2019;d failed to light into a fire. An empty bottle lay on its side. The light was coming from a small lantern, the phos globe within it guttering. The battery coil was nearly spent.</p><p>Our quarry sat with their backs against the rock wall. They were both dead. No doubt about that. Eyes bulged wide in their sockets, jaws hung open. Side by side, propped up like a pair of grisly puppets ready to launch into action. Alive, she would have been ordinary. A woman in her middle years with brown curls caught beneath a white cap, blue eyes flanked by crow&#x2019;s-feet. In death, her face and dress were stained with flakes of dried blood. It had leaked from her nose, her ears, her mouth. He&#x2019;d gone the same way. His uniform was stained with worse than Misery dust and sweat.</p><p>In life I wouldn&#x2019;t have looked twice at either one. In death I couldn&#x2019;t take my eyes away.</p><p>My unease intensified, rising from my guts to my chest. No visible wounds, just a lot of blood. Hadn&#x2019;t seen anything like this for a long time. The things in the Misery are vicious but they kill like animals. This was bloody, but it was neat. Almost like they&#x2019;d sat there, waiting to be killed.</p><p>&#x201c;Something got them,&#x201d; Nenn said. Has a real talent for pointing out the obvious, my Nenn.</p><p>&#x201c;No shit. It might still be here.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t know what in the hells it was, but it had done our job for us. I sucked in match smoke, took comfort in the acrid tang.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s long gone. Blood&#x2019;s been dry for hours.&#x201d;</p><p>Nenn lowered her firearm. She sat down on a large stone, looked across at the corpses with an expression that didn&#x2019;t usually register on what was left of her features. I couldn&#x2019;t tell what she was thinking. Didn&#x2019;t want to ask. I found a small pannier and rifled through its contents. Part of me hoped I&#x2019;d find something that I could sell to the marshal or the courts, make all this worth a little more of our while. They had little enough. A few jars of salt fish, not enough coins to make a decent wager. No secret missives, no maps to enemy tunnels, no list of sympathisers and spies in Valengrad. She&#x2019;d been a Talent, a phos-mill worker. He&#x2019;d been a lieutenant serving in an artillery company. Whatever their reason to abandon humanity and run out into the Misery, they&#x2019;d taken it to their grave. Which, I guess, we were standing in.</p><p>What a waste. Waste of my time, waste of the court&#x2019;s money to pay me, waste of their stupid lives.

From the Old Testament that anticipates him, to the Gospels that manifest him, to the Book of Acts that proclaims him, to the Epistles that explain him, and to the Book of Revelation that tells of him coming again, your Bible is about Jesus.

The writer Wallace Stegner famously referred to public lands as &#x201c;America&#x2019;s best idea,&#x201d; but there have always been some who oppose the idea for ideological reasons, or because they have a vested economic interest. In the current decade, federal public lands have been under physical threat as never before, with armed standoffs and takeovers that the US government has proved stunningly unsuccessful at prosecuting in federal courts.</p><p>One such incident was the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon, in 2016. Armed militants seized the headquarters of the refuge for forty-one days and occupied the community for three months. Militants threatened and harassed local residents, pledging to &#x201c;give back&#x201d; the land to unnamed &#x201c;rightful owners&#x201d; in their effort to enact a fringe interpretation of the US Constitution.</p><p>Drawing on more than two years of intensive fieldwork, <i>Sagebrush Collaboration</i> shows that the militants failed in their objectives because the sensible and hardworking citizens of Harney County had invested decades in collaboratively solving the very problems that the militia used to justify their anti&#x2013;federal government revolution.</p><p>In <i>Sagebrush Collaboration, </i>Peter Walker offers the first book-length study of why the 2016 takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge failed. His nuanced and deeply researched account provides the full context for the takeover, including the response from local and federal officials and the grassroots community resistance.

It&#x2019;s a triumphant business story of a company that began with a dream, remained true to the ideals of its founders&#x2014;antibureaucratic and artist driven&#x2014;and ended up a multibillion-dollar success. <br> <br> We meet Pixar&#x2019;s technical genius and founding CEO, Ed Catmull, who dreamed of becoming an animator, inspired by Disney&#x2019;s <i>Peter Pan</i> and <i>Pinocchio</i>, realized he would never be good enough, and instead enrolled in the then new field of computer science at the University of Utah. It was Catmull who founded the computer graphics lab at the New York Institute of Technology and who wound up at Lucasfilm during the first <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy, running the computer graphics department, and found a patron in Steve Jobs, just ousted from Apple Computer, who bought Pixar for five million dollars. Catmull went on to win four Academy Awards for his technical feats and helped to create some of the key computer-generated imagery software that animators rely on today. <br> <br> Price also writes about John Lasseter, who catapulted himself from unemployed animator to one of the most powerful figures in American filmmaking; animation was the only thing he ever wanted to do (he was inspired by Disney&#x2019;s <i>The Sword in the Stone</i>), and Price&#x2019;s book shows how Lasseter transformed computer animation from a novelty into an art form. The author writes as well about Steve Jobs, as volatile a figure as a Shakespearean monarch . . . <br> <br> Based on interviews with dozens of insiders, <i>The Pixar Touch</i> examines the early wildcat years when computer animation was thought of as the lunatic fringe of the medium. <br> <br> We see the studio at work today; how its writers, directors, and animators make their astonishing, and astonishingly popular, films. <br> <br> The book also delves into Pixar&#x2019;s corporate feuds: between Lasseter and his former champion, Jeffrey Katzenberg (<i>A Bug&#x2019;s Life</i> vs. <i>Antz</i>), and between Jobs and Michael Eisner. And finally it explores Pixar&#x2019;s complex relationship with the Walt Disney Company as it transformed itself from a Disney satellite into the $7.4 billion jewel in the Disney crown. <br> <br> <strong>Little-Known Facts from <i>The Pixar Touch: The Making of a Company</i> by David Price</strong> <br> <br> � Pixar, not Apple, made Steve Jobs a billionaire. Jobs bought Pixar in 1986 from Lucasfilm for $5 million. In 1995, the week after the release of <i>Toy Story</i>, Pixar went public and Jobs&#x2019;s stock was worth $1.1 <i>billion</i>. <br> <br> � Ed Catmull, Pixar&#x2019;s co-founder, dreamed as a youth of becoming an animator, but decided in high school that he couldn&#x2019;t draw well enough. Instead, he became an early visionary of computer animation as a graduate student in the 1970&#x2019;s. "Computer animation was sort of on the lunatic fringe at that time," remembered Fred Parke, a fellow Ph.D. student in Catmull&#x2019;s class at the University of Utah. <br> <br> � When John Lasseter joined Pixar&#x2014;which was then the computer graphics department of George Lucas&#x2019;s Lucasfilm&#x2014;he had just been fired from his dream job as an animator at Disney. He became the first person to apply classic Disney character animation principles to computer animation. <br> <br> � Before it became an animation studio, Pixar went through years of struggle and multi-million-dollar losses. It started as a computer company and John Lasseter&#x2019;s short films, such as <i>Luxo Jr.</i> and <i>Tin Toy</i>, were promotional films to help sell the company&#x2019;s computers. <br> <br> � Pixar was almost bought by...Microsoft? Yep: Jobs remained worried about the company&#x2019;s finances even after Pixar made a deal with the Walt Disney Co. in 1991 to produce <i>Toy Story</i>, Pixar&#x2019;s first feature film. <i>The Pixar Touch</i> details the effort to sell Pixar to Bill Gates&#x2019;s company while <i>Toy Story</i> was in production. <br> <br> � When writing <i>Toy Story</i>, to find inspiration for the relationship between Buzz and Woody, Lasseter and his story department screened classic "buddy" movies, including <i>48 Hrs.</i>, <i>The Defiant Ones</i>, <i>Midnight Run</i>, and <i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i>. <br> <br> � John Lasseter has instilled an intense commitment to research in the studio&#x2019;s creative staff. To prepare for the scene in <i>Finding Nemo</i> in which the fish characters Marlin and Dory become trapped in a whale, two members of the art department climbed inside a dead gray whale that had been stranded north of Marin, California. <br> <br> � To learn how to make a realistic French kitchen, the producer and first director of <i>Ratatouille</i> worked as apprentices at an elite French restaurant in the Napa Valley. <br> <br> � Pixar deliberately avoided making the humans in <i>The Incredibles</i> look too realistic. They knew that as animated human characters became too close to lifelike, audiences would actually perceive them as repulsive. The phenomenon, known as the "uncanny valley," had been predicted by a Japanese robotics researcher as early as 1970. Thus, the details of human skin, such as pores and hair follicles, were left out of <i>The Incredibles</i>&#x2019; characters in favor of a more cartoonlike appearance. <br> <br> � The signature of most Pixar feature films is characters who appeal to children (toys, fish, monsters...), but who have adult-like personalities and are dealing with adult-like problems. <br> <br> � Prior to the acquisition of Pixar by Disney in 2006, Lasseter loathed the idea of Disney making sequels to Pixar films without Pixar&#x2019;s involvement&#x2014;as Disney&#x2019;s contract with Pixar allowed it to do. "These were the people that put out <i>Cinderella II</i>," Lasseter remarked. <br> <br> � Pixar is more than an animation studio. Pixar&#x2019;s innovations in computer graphics technology pervade movies today. Special-effects houses like Industrial Light &amp; Magic (<i>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x2019;s Chest</i>, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe</i>, <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i>) use Pixar&#x2019;s software to create out-of-this-world places and characters. <br> <br> <p></p> (Photo � Simon Bruty) <p></p>David A.

They began a quest to reclaim the purity of nature for themselves. They chose as their Eden the dry, uninhabited volcanic island of Floreana in the Galapagos chain. Their experiences in their new paradise&#x2014;and the ensuing scandals&#x2014;would captivate the Western world.</p> <p>Floreana's unforgiving environment hardly proved to be a idyllic choice, and were it not for the assistance of American yachters, Ritter and Strauch, naive and unprepared as they were, might easily have perished during their first year as colonists. </p> <p>Yacht crews returned with news of the eccentric couple's adventures, and they became darlings of the Western press. This unwelcome publicity lead to the arrival of a second family on the island, soon followed by a pistol-wielding Austrian "baroness" and her two young lovers. While not without her charm, this mysterious "aristocrat" could also be sinister and controlling. Tensions grew rapidly, jealousies and resentments raged, and soon this island with a population of 9 was at war with itself.</p> <p> Floreana was to become rife with danger, suspicion, murderous thoughts, and a notorious scandal that still entices today. Who was the "Satan" who came to Eden? Was it a singular person, or was it the darkness of self-destruction that can arise in every human heart? It is a question for each reader to answer in their own way and it beckons to the aspiring detective in all of us. </p> <p>Originally published in 1936, <i>Satan Came to Eden</i> meticulously recounts Ritter and Strauch's often bizarre, true-life struggle from a survivor's point of view&#x2014;an account lost to the public for nearly 80 years.

So widely documented is the participation of the School&#x2019;s graduates in torture, murder, and political repression throughout Latin America that in 2001 the School officially changed its name to the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. Lesley Gill goes behind the fa�ade and presents a comprehensive portrait of the School of the Americas. Talking to a retired Colombian general accused by international human rights organizations of terrible crimes, sitting in on classes, accompanying soa students and their families to an upscale local mall, listening to coca farmers in Colombia and Bolivia, conversing with anti-soa activists in the cramped office of the School of the Americas Watch&#x2014;Gill exposes the School&#x2019;s institutionalization of state-sponsored violence, the havoc it has wrought in Latin America, and the strategies used by activists seeking to curtail it.<p></p><p>Based on her unprecedented level of access to the School of the Americas, Gill describes the School&#x2019;s mission and training methods and reveals how its students, alumni, and officers perceive themselves in relation to the dirty wars that have raged across Latin America. Assessing the School&#x2019;s role in U.S. empire-building, she shows how Latin America&#x2019;s brightest and most ambitious military officers are indoctrinated into a stark good-versus-evil worldview, seduced by consumer society and the &#x201c;American dream,&#x201d; and enlisted as proxies in Washington&#x2019;s war against drugs and &#x201c;subversion.&#x201d;</p></p><p>&#34;Lesley Gill&#39;s study of the premier military training operation in the Americas is a treasure trove of histories that will provoke a long overdue debate about the values and limits of U.S. engagement in the region.&#34;--Robin Kirk, author of &#34;More Terrible Than Death: Massacres, Drugs, and America&#39;s War in Colombia&#34;<p>Lesley Gill is Professor of Anthropology and Department Chair, Vanderbilt University.

Culpeper, a Puritan, was the son of a clergyman. In 1634 he spent a year at Cambridge, where he learned Greek and Latin, which enabled him to study old medical texts. He was apprenticed to an apothecary and started his formal practice in Spitalfields, London, around 1640. Culpeper supported the Parliamentary side in the English Civil War, suffering a severe chest wound in 1643. After recovering he returned to his medical practice in London, where he established a reputation as an outstanding healer. War wounds combined with overwork led to his death by exhaustion in 1654, aged 37. According to his widow, he left behind some 70 unfinished manuscripts.

And so Buddhism has developed methods for purifying our past, clearing the obstacles to success and fulfillment. One of the most popular methods for karmic housekeeping, one common to all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, is the preparatory practice of visualizing the buddha Vajrasattva and reciting his hundred-syllable mantra. It is considered an essential foundation for the success of spiritual endeavor. <br> The practice of Vajrasattva is often the first experience practitioners have of trying to perform tantric ritual. Combining prayers, visualizations, mantra recitations, and multiple styles of meditation, it can be hard for those who did not grow up in the tradition to know how to proceed. This friendly volume by a young Tibetan lama with many followers in China lays out the practice step by step accompanied by sixty color illustrations.</p><p><b>Khenpo Yeshe Phuntsok</b> was born in China's Sichuan province in 1971 and educated in both Chinese and Tibetan.

Louis T. Talbot clearly and reliably outlines a comprehensive view of the plan of God from the beginning of Genesis to the close of Revelation. / The definite purpose of God for each age is made apparent through a detailed study of Scripture as the plan is unfolded: the creation of humankind and the age of innocence, the fall and the age of conscience, the age of human government, the age of law, the church age, the return of Christ and his thousand-years reign, and the new heavens and new earth. / Talbot also answers many troublesome questions concerning the end-time prophecies of Daniel and of Revelation. He makes clear, for example, the difference between the &#x201c;judgment seat of Christ&#x201d; and &#x201c;the great white throne.&#x201d; He also demonstrates why the premillennial concept is the correct one, and shows from Scripture that the church will be translated at the beginning of &#x201c;the great tribulation&#x201d; in order to spare it from the purifying judgments to follow. / God's Plan of the Ages is a Christian classic that has value not only to students of prophecy but to all Christians who desire a comprehensive view of God's grand design for eternity.</p><p>Louis T.

Yet, the science underpinning this technology is less visible and little understood outside the professional computer science community. As a scientific discipline, computer science stands alongside the likes of molecular biology and cognitive science as one of the most significant new sciences of the post Second World War era. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Subrata Dasgupta sheds light on these lesser known areas and considers the conceptual basis of computer science. Discussing algorithms, programming, and sequential and parallel processing, he considers emerging modern ideas such as biological computing and cognitive modelling, challenging the idea of computer science as a science of the artificial. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

The authors examine all aspects of the presidency in rich detail, including the president&#x2019;s powers, presidential history, and the institution of the presidency. Guiding their analysis is their unique contrast between two broad perspectives on the presidency&#x2014;the constrained president (&#x201c;facilitator&#x201d;) and the dominant president (&#x201c;director&#x201d;)&#x2014;making the text a perennial favorite for courses on the presidency. <br><br>The authors richly illustrate their engaging analysis with timely, fascinating examples. They fully integrate the Trump presidency into every chapter, offering wide-ranging coverage. Moreover, they devote separate chapters to essential aspects of President Trump&#x2019;s approach to governing such as on media relations, leading the public, and decision making. Equally important, they incorporate the most recent scholarship and their own unique approach to show how the Trump presidency illuminates our basic understanding of the presidency, making Presidential Leadership the perfect vehicle for understanding the president and his impact on the office.</p><p>George C.

In this rich and wide-ranging book, Terry Pinkard interweaves the story of &#34;Germany&#34;--changing during this period from a loose collection of principalities into a newly-emerged nation with a distinctive culture--with an examination of the currents and complexities of its developing philosophical thought. He examines the dominant influence of Kant, with his revolutionary emphasis on &#34;self-determination,&#34; and traces this influence through the development of romanticism and idealism to the critiques of post-Kantian thinkers such as Schopenhauer and Kierkegaard. His book will interest a range of readers in the history of philosophy, cultural history and the history of ideas. Terry Pinkard is professor of Philosophy at Northwestern University and is the author of the acclaimed Hegel: A Biography (Cambridge, 2000).

With words that revel and reveal, she shares love's painful beauty.</p><p>Musically compelling, risky, original: yes. But the most salient characteristic of Sonia Sanchez's <i>Like the Singing Coming Off the Drums</i> is passion. There's enough erotic exuberance in these poems to make even Cupid blush, starting with the opening salvo: "you held me so close / we were like the singing coming off drums. / you made me squeeze muscles / lean back on the sound / of corpuscles sliding in blood. I heard my thighs singing." The intensity of Sanchez's love poetry can leave us breathless. Yet she is very much the public poet as well as the private one. Her collection includes tributes to such icons as Ella Fitzgerald, Tupac Amaru Shakur, Toni Cade Bambara, Cornel West, and Gwendolyn Brooks. Sanchez also produces a portrait of an HIV-positive woman, which builds to an affirmative crescendo: <blockquote> ...I ammmmmmmm<br> the universe knows that<br> I ammmmmmm<br> hiv positive but I ammm<br> still. woman. lover. mother.<br> sistah. artist. organizer. activist.<br> woman...<br> </blockquote> At her best, Sanchez bridges gender, age and race, speaking in the closest we can expect to a universal language.

As archbishop of the Archdiocese of New York in the 1840 and 1850s and the most famous Roman Catholic in America, Hughes defended Catholic institutions in a time of nativist bigotry and church burnings and worked tirelessly to help Irish Catholic immigrants find acceptance in their new homeland. His galvanizing and protecting work and pugnacious style earned him the epithet Dagger John. When the interests of his church and ethnic community were at stake, Hughes acted with purpose and clarity.</p><p>In <i>Dagger John</i>, Loughery reveals Hughes&#x2019;s life as it unfolded amid turbulent times for the religious and ethnic minority he represented. Hughes the public figure comes to the fore, illuminated by Loughery&#x2019;s retelling of his interactions with, and responses to, every major figure of his era, including his critics (Walt Whitman, James Gordon Bennett, and Horace Greeley) and his admirers (Henry Clay, Stephen Douglas, and Abraham Lincoln). Loughery peels back the layers of the public life of this complicated man, showing how he reveled in the controversies he provoked and believed he had lived to see many of his goals achieved until his dreams came crashing down during the Draft Riots of 1863 when violence set Manhattan ablaze.</p><p>To know "Dagger" John Hughes is to understand the United States during a painful period of growth as the nation headed toward civil war. Dagger John&#x2019;s successes and failures, his public relationships and private trials, and his legacy in the Irish Catholic community and beyond provide context and layers of detail for the larger history of a modern culture unfolding in his wake.</p></p><p><p>John Loughery is the author of three books, <i>Alias S. S. Van Dine</i>, <i>John Sloan</i>, and <i>The Other Side of Silence</i>, the last two of which were <i>New York Times</i> Notable Books. His biography of John Sloan was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Biography.</p><p>"Loughery's thoroughly researched and engagingly written study offers many new insights into Hughes's life and times....

Gathering her paints and notebook, she heads into the Arizona Sonoran Desert to explore its treasures. Sketching, painting, and writing, she records all that she sees and as night falls, she spreads out her pictures to make this scrapbook of her day, from dawn to dusk.</p><p>Subtitled ``Dawn to Dusk in the Sonoran Desert,'' this is a fascinating personal introduction to the ecology of a desert. In her first solo effort, Wright-Frierson (illustrator of Sheila Cole's When the Tide Is Low, 1985, among others) organizes her book as a series of dawn-to-dusk, sketchbook impressions made during many trips to the desert for observation and watercolor painting. The vivid text takes the form of involving first-person journal entries that accompany accurate, beautiful watercolors of the desert (in one, she includes her own hands sketching in a notebook as part of the illustration). Roadrunners, tortoises, jackrabbits, snakes, elf owls, and woodpeckers are just a few of the animals observed and documented in their habitat, while Saguaro cactus, creosote, acacia, prickly pear, and mesquite fill each page. There is much to enjoy, but the first lessons to absorb are on becoming careful, consistent investigators of nature. Exemplary science writing. (Picture book/nonfiction. 6-9) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 3-6?An artist's readable narrative accompanies her accomplished drawings in this slim, colorful volume. Wright-Frierson invites readers to spend a day in her company, savoring the Sonoran Desert of the American Southwest. She presents a dawn to dusk panorama in a profusion of watercolor sketches and a brief, conversational text. While calling to mind Jennifer Dewey's Night and Day in the Desert (Little, 1991) or Joyce Powzyk's Wallaby Creek (Lothrop, 1985), this artist's sketchbook is intensely personal. Her goal is not scientific depth, though the snippets of information may well entice the intellectually curious to conduct further investigations. Rather, her "scrapbook" serves to give a rich impression of a unique ecological environment: a feel for a landscape of compelling extremes and the creatures who have adapted to meet its unforgiving demands.

At the end of a 130-meter long tunnel chiseled out of solid stone is a room filled with humanity&#x2019;s precious treasure, the largest and most diverse seed collection ever assembled: more than a half billion seeds containing the world&#x2019;s most prized crops, a safeguard against catastrophic starvation.<br></p><p><br>The Global Seed Vault, a visionary model of international collaboration, is the brainchild of Cary Fowler, renowned scientist, conservationist, and biodiversity advocate. In SEEDS ON ICE, Fowler tells for the first time the comprehensive inside story of how the doomsday seed vault&#x201d; came to be, while the breathtaking photographs offer a stunning guided tour not only of the private vault, but of the windswept beauty and majesty of Svalbard and the enchanting community of people in Longyearbyen.<br></p><p><br>With growing evidence that unchecked climate change will seriously undermine food production and threaten the diversity of crops around the world, SEEDS ON ICE offers a personal and passionate reminder that we shouldn&#x2019;t take our reliance on the world of plants for granted and that, in a very real sense, the future of the human race rides on this frozen and indispensable biodiversity.</p></p><p>Cary Fowler served as the Executive Director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust from 2005 to 2012.

Because the Global Seed Vault isn&#x2019;t open to the public, Fowler&#x2019;s book is the only view of it most of us will ever get which is why the coffee-table book format actually works. So as Fowler catalogs the history of agriculture, the long road of crop diversification and, more recently, of how many varieties have already been lost, we get stunning photography to keep us turning the pages. . . . If the pictures of polar bears and collapsing ice shelves aren&#x2019;t message enough of the timeliness of both the project and the book, Fowler also notes that the Global Seed Vault has already proved its worth. The first seed withdrawal came in 2015, when deposits that had been made from a gene bank in Syria were sent back to help re-establish the banks in the region."<br> <i>The Los Angeles Times</i><br><p><br> If you&#x2019;re already familiar with the Global Seed Vault and understand the crucial role it might play in the future of humanity, you can think of Cary Fowler&#x2019;s new book as a beautiful coffee-table ornament with the bonus of lots of informative, readable text.

Now this landmark work has been updated and expanded -- with five all-new chapters -- to meet today&#39;s continuing challenges to the nation&#39;s productivity and morale. Danger in the Comfort Zone examines the phenomenon of the &#34;&#34;entitlement&#34;&#34; mentality in the American workforce -- people&#39;s preoccupation with their rewards rather than their responsibilities. Bardwick describes three basic mindsets and shows the effect of each on individuals and their organizations: * Entitlement -- people feel entitled to rewards and lethargic about having to earn them; motivation and job satisfaction are low * Fear -- people are paralyzed; the threat of layoffs makes them focus on protecting their jobs rather than doing them well * Earning -- people are energized by challenge; they know their accomplishments will be noticed -- and rewarded In this paperback edition, Bardwick points out that although the &#34;&#34;fear&#34;&#34; element has undoubtedly grown in the last few years, the entitlement attitude is still firmly entrenched at all levels. She offers additional chapters with new, specific techniques for pulling people out of the quagmire of fear and complacency, and igniting them with the energy of true earning.&#34;</p><p>JUDITH M.

The Siglio edition preserves the graphic effects, but, more important, it gives a sense of the company he kept during these years&#x2015;Marcel Duchamp, R. Buckminster Fuller, D.T. Suzuki&#x2015;and of his passionate feeling about a world locked in a state of perpetual warfare. Cage has a reputation for being a Zen-inspired wit. He was also much more, an intensely engaged moral thinker.&#x201d; &#x2013;Holland Cotter, <i>New York Times</i></strong></p><p>Now available in an expanded paperback edition, <i>Diary</i> registers Cage&#x2019;s assessment of the times in which he lived as well as his often uncanny portents about the world we live in now. With a great sense of play as well as purpose, Cage traverses vast territory, from the domestic minutiae of everyday life to ideas about how to feed the world. He used chance operations to determine not only the word count and the application of various typefaces but also the number of letters per line, the patterns of indentation, and&#x2015;in the case of Part Three, originally published by Something Else Press&#x2015;color. The unusual visual variances on the page become almost musical as language takes on a physical and aural presence.<br><br>While Cage used chance operations to expand the possibilities of creating and shaping his work beyond the limitations of individual taste, <i>Diary</i> nonetheless accumulates into a complex reflection of Cage&#x2019;s sensibilities as a thinker and citizen of the world, illuminating his social and political awareness, as well as his idealism and sense of humor: it becomes an oblique but indelible portrait of one the most influential figures of the 20th-century American avant-garde.<br><br>Collecting all eight parts into a single volume, coeditors Joe Biel and Richard Kraft also used chance operations to render the entire text in various combinations of red and blue (used by Dick Higgins and Alison Knowles for Part Three) as well as to apply a single set of 18 fonts to the entire work. In the editors&#x2019; note, Kraft and Biel elucidate the procedure of chance operations and demonstrate its application, giving readers a rare opportunity to see how the text is transformed.<br><br>This expanded paperback edition reproduces the 2015 hardback edition, with a new essay by mycologist and Cage aficionado David Rose and, most important, an addendum that includes many facsimile pages of Cage&#x2019;s handwritten notebook of a ninth part in progress, bringing the reader into compelling proximity to Cage&#x2019;s process and the raw material from which <i>Diary</i> was made.</p></p><p>[John Cage: Diary] is no ordinary account of days gone by; a plain record of events would be too simple for such a daring and meticulous artist.

In the eleventh summer, everything changed. A hunting rifle with a single cartridge left in the chamber wound up in exactly the wrong hands at exactly the wrong time, and led to a nightmarish accident that put to the test the values that unite the family&#x2014;and the convictions that just may pull it apart.&nbsp;<br><br></p></p><p>If you imagine most writer's bathrooms (and this is probably a mistake) you'd picture damp towels in a clump on the floor, hair in the soap, a few mildewed paperbacks stacked on the counter. But it's impossible to picture Chris Bohjalian's bathroom as anything but an <i>Architectural Digest</i> centerfold: polished counters, not a stray thread on the plush towels, the modulated colors sparked to life by fresh flowers from a neighbor's garden.<p> Bohjalian's eighth novel, <i>Before You Know Kindness</i>, is a beautifully observed, delicately balanced portrait of a family that could only come from the hands of a tireless craftsman who keeps reaching into his story to straighten the tulips or tuck in a shirttail. It begins with two EMTs leaning over animal rights' activist Spencer McCullough's gushing shotgun wound and winds back through the ordinary days leading up to the extraordinary accident, and then forward again as Spencer and his family come to terms with what has happened. As ambitious as other Bohjalian novels, <i>Before You Know Kindness</i> spirals out to encompass the larger issues of Spencer's political loyalties and the heartless, passionate world of political spin. Some readers may find Bohjalian's style too smooth. Others will relish the completeness of his vision and his obvious tenderness for even the most difficult of his characters. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>Chris Bohjalian, bestselling author of Midwives, presents his most ambitious and multi-layered novel to date--examining wildly divisive issues in today's America with his trademark emotional heft and spellbinding storytelling skill. <br>On a balmy July night in New Hampshire a shot rings out in a garden, and a man falls to the ground, terribly wounded.

Tired of struggling with that heavy plastic kayak? Are you looking for a lightweight boat but not willing to take out a second mortgage to buy it? What if I told you that you could build a boat weighting less than 35 lbs for $300 to $500? You can and in my new book I will show you how. This style was very popular in the 1950&#39;s and 1960&#39;s and many boat plans appeared in magazines such as Popular Mechanics and Popular Science. Even though it is no longer fashionable in the magazines, the fuselage style of construction is still probably the most cost effective way to build a small boat. Recently I have seen a renewed interest in this type of boat construction. People are rediscovering the advantages of Fuselage style Skin Boats. Fuselage frames boats cost very little to build. A sheet of marine plywood, a lightweight wood such as cedar for the stringers, a few yards of a synthetic fabric for the skin and something to waterproof the skin. Materials for a basic 17&#39; kayak cost around $300. Adding a seat, deck rigging and adjustable footrest would add another $100 to $150 dollars depending on your preferences. For somewhere around $400 you can build a high performance, 30-35 lbs boat. A composite construction canoe or kayak of similar weight would cost thousands of dollars. This book will walk you through the process of building your own Skin on Frame canoe or kayak. I start by addressing the space needed to build a boat as well as tools needed. There is a detailed section on laying out the frames from a table of offsets. Progressing to how to assemble the frame, skinning the boat and through all the steps to preparing your boat for launching. Included are offsets for three of my boat designs. The StoneFly canoe, Curlew, a 15&#39; Sea Kayak and new sea kayak design Pouco Barta.</p><p>I had a sneak peak at Jeff's book, and I can attest that it's very well done.

Professor Lynne Murphy is on the linguistic front line. In <i>The Prodigal Tongue</i> she explores the fiction and reality of the special relationship between British and American English. By examining the causes and symptoms of American Verbal Inferiority Complex and its flipside, British Verbal Superiority Complex, Murphy unravels the prejudices, stereotypes and insecurities that shape our attitudes to our own language.<br> &nbsp;<br> With great humo(u)r and new insights, Lynne Murphy looks at the social, political and linguistic forces that have driven American and British English in different directions: how Americans got from <i>centre</i> to <i>center</i>, why British accents are growing away from American ones, and what different things we mean when we say estate, frown, or middle class. Is anyone winning this war of the words? Will Yanks and Brits ever really understand each other?</p><p><b>Lynne Murphy </b>is Professor of Linguistics at the University of Sussex. Born and raised in New York State, she studied Linguistics at the Universities of Massachusetts and Illinois, before starting her academic career in South Africa and Texas. Since 2000, she has lived in Brighton, England, where she has acquired an English husband, an English daughter, and an alter ego: Lynneguist, author of the award-winning blog<i> Separated by a Common Language</i>.<b>1</b><br><br><b>The Queen's English, Corrupted</b><br><br>If there is a more hideous language on the face of the earth than the American form of English, I should like to know what it is!<br><br>Baron Somers, in the House of Lords (1979)<br><br>Americans are ruining the English language. I know this because people go out of their way to tell me so. I am a magnet for such comments-an American who dares to teach English Language and Linguistics at a British university and who has the chutzpah to write about American and British language differences on the internet. But you don't need me to tell you about the wrecking ball that is American English-the talking heads of Britain have been pointing it out for years. English is under attack from American words that are "mindless" (the Mail on Sunday), "ugly and pointless" (BBC Magazine), "infectious, destructive and virulent" (the Daily Mail). American words "infect, invade, and pollute" (The Times). Even Prince Charles has assessed the situation, warning that American English is "very corrupting."<br><br>Perhaps you had thought someone or something else was causing English's demise. Maybe it's inarticulate young people, bent on creating a future English that consists of little more than strings of so like kinda this and stuff. Or is technology responsible? BBC journalist John Humphrys likens text-messagers to Genghis Khan; they are vandals who are "pillaging our punctuation; savaging our sentences; raping our vocabulary." Business jargon is another likely suspect. Don Watson, in his book Gobbledygook, argues that management-speak expressions "sterilise the language and kill imagination and clarity." In fact, the plain-language promoters at Clarity International blame business jargon for the financial crisis of 2008-the language of banking had become so meaningless that customers could not understand the risks they were signing up for.<br><br>But look closer and you may decide that all these dangers to English are just symptoms of a linguistic malady whose ground zero is the United States. For instance, if young people are ruining the Queen's English, should we blame them, or blame America? The United States invented 20th-century childhood, which continues to shape culture worldwide in the 21st century. The seen-but-not-heard Victorian girls and boys of Britain have been replaced by the American inventions of the teenager and the tween. Children born in Essex or Edinburgh or Aberystwyth live part of their lives in a virtual America, home of hip-hop, Disney princesses, caped superheroes, and fast food. The situation is bad enough that in 2007 the British media regulator Ofcom (the equivalent of the US Federal Communications Commission) called for a national debate on the proliferation of American children's television on British screens. "We don't want our children growing up with American accents," proclaimed former BBC Play School presenter Baroness Floella Benjamin. It may be too late. British young people, like their American counterparts are, like, ending their statements as if they were, like, questions?<br><br>And the youthful English speakers are not all that young anymore. As Oscar Wilde observed: "The youth of America is their oldest tradition. It has been going on now for three hundred years." More than a hundred years after Wilde's quip, the lines between childhood and adulthood have become blurred by adults' refusal to put away childish things, with the US leading the way. The American invention of the word kidult underscores the point. In kidulthood, grown-up speech becomes more casual: no one wants to be called Mister or ma'am. We feel free to mumble our gonnas and lemmes. And everything is awesome.<br><br>Technology and business are similar stealth American invasions into global English. American technology spills foreignisms throughout the anglophonic world. We talk of uploads, of microwaving food, of personal computers. The technologies crossed oceans and so did the words. Microsoft Word asks British users to set the font "color." Facebook teaches us to unfriend people and unlike things, then puts a grumpy red line under perfectly good English spellings like practise with an s and travelled with double l. This increasingly technologized, globalized world brings us business jargon, the language of optimism and obfuscation. Surely going forward, reaching out, and leveraging our real-time client synergy is the fault of go-getting, pop-psychologizing American suits.<br><br>We can actually quantify the horror that American English arouses. After using a thesaurus in order to find adjectives meaning 'good,' 'useful,' 'bad,' and 'useless,' I searched the internet for the phrase a(n) _____ Americanism, inserting the synonyms into the blank. I'm happy to report that on that particular day the worldwide web knew of 227 lovely Americanisms, 73 apt ones, and even 5 elegant ones. But the top six not-so-flattering adjectives are slightly more numerous. (I've lived in England long enough to have mastered the ironic understatement.)<br><br>The internet's top six adjectives modifying Americanism<br><br>Flattering Not-so-flattering<br><br>227 Lovely Ugly 7,780<br><br>231 Nice Horrible 4,780<br><br>100 Useful Vile 3,610<br><br>73 Apt Awful 1,700<br><br>25 Delightful Dreadful 963<br><br>5 Elegant Nasty 373<br><br>That's nearly thirty times as many not-so-flattering adjectives as flattering ones, just looking at the top six. After the top six, the flattering list stops, but the not-so-flattering one goes on. And on.<br><br>American English-the language of my childhood, my dear mom and dad, the teachers who introduced me to Shakespeare; the language of Sesame Street, Barack Obama, Maya Angelou, and Mark Twain-is Linguistic Public Enemy Number 1 in much of the English-speaking world. So far we've seen it described as a pollution, a disease, a destructive force, an aesthetic horror. The repetition of these refrains in my adopted country makes it difficult for me to maintain a stereotype that Americans hold dear: that the British are a polite and intelligent people.<br><br>Is American English really a disease that infects other languages, particularly the mother tongue of England? Or are we seeing the influence of linguistic hypochondriacs, diagnosing idiocy and destruction where there is none? Are Americanisms evil pollutants that disintegrate minds? Or do they inoculate English against a wasting atrophy? The answers to these questions are more complicated than the linguistic Chicken Littles ("The sky is falling! The language is imploding!") are willing to admit.<br><br>This book provides an arsenal of facts and an armful of interpretations that, I hope, might heighten our enjoyment of our common language and our pride in it. What if, instead of worrying about the "ruination" of English by young people, jargonistas, or Americans, we celebrated English for being robust enough to allow such growth and variety? What if instead of judging people (including ourselves) on the basis of pronunciation or grammar, we listened to what they had to say and enjoyed how they said it? What if instead of tutting, we marveled? Humor me with that for the length of this book. Then, if you must, you can go back to complaining.<br><br>Statements like "British is best" or "American is simpler" are just too glib to do our language justice. The ideas to be pilloried in the following chapters include:<br><br>One kind of English is more pure than another.<br><br>One kind of English is more precise than the other.<br><br>American and British English differences amount to just a few spellings and some funny words.<br><br>British English is older than American English.<br><br>American and British English will soon be indistinguishable.<br><br>English can be hurt by speaking it wrong.<br><br>Maybe you hold some of those beliefs. You certainly know people who do. They're harder beliefs to hold once you've looked closely at the full range of linguistic differences and similarities. These differences are superficial and deep, simple and complex, blatant and sneaky: the spelling of colo(u)r, the pronunciation of garage, the meaning of frown, whether you eat mashed potato or mashed potatoes. They touch on the language's relationships with time, with the landscape, with other languages, and especially with social class and self-image. They raise questions about what we value in our language. Is tradition more important than efficiency? Do we judge good English by what authorities say about it or by how people actually talk? Is it better to have many different ways to "English," or would we be better off with a more uniform language?<br><br>I'm not going to try to answer those questions for you. In fact, if I get my way, you may be more unsettled about these issues than when you picked up this book. Whether you value tradition or innovation, efficiency or poeticism, localness or universality, you may find that those things are harder to pin down once you dig deep into the mire that is English.<br><br>Anti-Americanism(-ism)<br><br>There is no such thing as American English. There is English. And there are mistakes.<br><br>@QueenUK (not Her Majesty)<br><br>When it became clear that American independence (on American terms) was inevitable, King George III vowed to "keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment [are] converted into penitence and remorse." But with other colonies to manage and Napoleon coming on the scene, the harassment did not last long. Today, with our bloody tax-and-governance dispute well behind us, the Anglo-American "special relationship" is one of the strongest allegiances in the world. David Cameron and Barack Obama took time in 2012 to write in the Washington Post:<br><br>The alliance between the United States and Great Britain is a partnership of the heart, bound by the history, traditions and values we share. But what makes our relationship special-a unique and essential asset-is that we join hands across so many endeavors. Put simply, we count on each other and the world counts on our alliance.<br><br>Notably absent from their list of what binds us is language. We can only guess how much Cameron cringed when he saw a u-less endeavor in a piece he had coauthored. No one is really sure who first quipped that the two countries are "separated by a common language," but our linguistic differences have long been noted and stewed over. In 1756, just after the publication of his great dictionary (but before there was a United States), Samuel Johnson referred to "the trace of corruption" in the language of an American book he reviewed. That he enjoyed the book at all is a testament to its author's skill and elegance, for as a loyal subject of the monarchy Johnson was no fan of the uppity colonists: "Had we treated the Americans as we ought, and as they deserved, we should have at once razed all their towns and let them enjoy their forests."<br><br>All its life, the United States has had European naysayers. In the past century, distaste for America and its exports has been couched in terms of resistance to American cultural imperialism. Before that, it was America's radical rejection of the old inheritance-based roots of power that struck fear and disgust in the hearts of many. European anti-Americanism was born out of "astonishment over the new society [. . .] in which for the first time social stratification had no value," according to Dutch historian Jan Schulte Nordholt. Titles and family connections were much less important in the new country; what mattered was what an individual could achieve and accrue in their lifetime. "Soon one of the fixed stereotypes about America was that everything there was determined by money and everything could be had for a price."<br><br>It may be hard for us in individualistic, democratic, western societies of the 21st century to appreciate how unsettling American independence was. These days, we roll our eyes at the Declaration of Independence's contention that "all men are created equal" and point out that its authors kept slaves. But for many 18th-century Europeans, the complete rejection of monarchy, aristocracy, and state religion looked like something very dangerous indeed. How could authority come from the people, when the people might very well have parochial interests, uneven education, and different ideas about God? Many, like Samuel Johnson, thought it ungrateful and unseemly that American colonists protested British laws and taxes, considering that they had benefited from the British crown's protection in disputes with other colonial powers and Native Americans in the New World.<br><br>Feelings against America were (and are) in no way limited to British monarchists. Even those who admired the United States' democratic project came to doubt the value of its people and their products. Charles Dickens had hoped to find in America less social stratification than he knew in London. Instead, he found nitwits. "I do not believe there are, on the whole earth besides, so many intensified bores as in these United States." Many have suspected that the immigrants who populated the new country were not the best and the brightest that Europe had to offer, but were instead, as American journalist H. L. Mencken described them, "incompetents who could not get on at home." The immigrant m&#x17d;lange of America could not be trusted to bring refined manners, learned culture, or the best English (among other languages) to the New World.<br><br>But those who worry about the d&#x17d;class&#x17d; Americans tend to be those who have the most invested in (and the most to gain from) the traditions and language that are associated with the British upper classes. The anti-British-establishment United States, its products, and its ideas were more popular with the commoners-cum-working classes of Europe than with those further up the social ladder. That hasn't really changed. At the close of the 20th century, journalist Alexander Chancellor observed that the British upper class has been "generally more anti-American than the working class because it felt more directly affronted by America's assumption of Britain's former role as a world power."<br><br>European distaste for all things American often has an air of befuddled paternalism to it: How can a culture exist without a history? Those from more ancient cultures might look upon the United States as a parent might judge a toddler. The tot might be adorable and precocious in saying his ABCs, but he's still just a child. We're not going to hang his finger paintings alongside the Mona Lisa. His ideas and language are limited by the extent of his tiny experience, and so we don't have to take them too seriously. But then reality kicks in: that New World upstart is actually an influential player. And those words he spouts: Are they some kind of stealth weapon against all that is good and true in English?<br><br>From anti-Americanism-ism to amerilexicophobia<br><br>For shame, Mr Jefferson!

How did he "perpetually trample upon the very grammar of our language"? He had (it seems) invented the word belittle.

She lives in New York City with her husband, Gabriel.<b>Praise for <i>The Whole Art of Detection</i>:</b><br><br>&#x201c;One of the best examples of [Sherlock Holmes pastiche] that this die-hard Sherlockian has encountered . . . Faye perfectly captures the tone and spirit of the Conan Doyle originals.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Adam Woog, <i>Seattle Times</i></b><br><br> A great pastiche requires an uncanny ear for Watson&#x2019;s voice as well as a talent for a compelling story. Fortunately, Lyndsay Faye has plenty of both gifts, as she already proved in her near-perfect <i>Dust and Shadow</i>. For those who despair that Arthur Conan Doyle only gave us 60 stories of Holmes, rejoice! Here are 15 more treasures!&#x201d;<b> Leslie S. Klinger, editor of <i>The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes</i></b><br><br> <i>The Whole Art of Detection</i> is a great look at the Victorian world and the criminal goings on that gave us Sherlock. The London of the late 19th Century is awash with would be criminal masterminds who must be contained. It&#x2019;s a great look at the London of Holmes and the threats that emerge from an active criminal underground.&#x201d;<b> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, author of <i>Mycroft Holmes</i></b><br><br> As full of wit as it is of twists, <i>The Whole Art of Detection</i> is a clever collection of deeply satisfying stories that capture the essence of Doyle&#x2019;s work while marking an impressive addition to the Holmes canon.&#x201d;<b> Graham Moore, author of <i>The Sherlockian</i> and <i>The Last Days of Night</i></b><br><br> <i>The Whole Art of Detection</i> belongs on the top shelf with the very best of Doyle's Holmes stories. Author Faye has captured the language, locutions and inventiveness of the original tales as well or better than any author I can think of it. It is absolutely essential reading for any and every aficionado who cherishes the real thing.&#x201d;<b> Nicholas Meyer, author of <i>The Seven-Per-Cent Solution</i></b><br><br> A new Lyndsay Faye book is always noteworthy but for those Sherlockians among us who take our pastiches seriously, <i>The Whole Art of Detection</i> is a special cause for celebration. Faye&#x2019;s mastery of Watson&#x2019;s narrative voice and skilled plotting are, at this point, to be expected; as is her period research, which manages to be dazzling and unobtrusive at the same time. But it&#x2019;s how she treats the Holmes/Watson relationship that is unique. The humor, the familiarity, the deep affection, the occasional arguments and hurt feelings Lyndsay Faye is matchless at rendering the very human people at the center of the most famous partnership in fiction. Truly, <i>The Whole Art of Detection</i> is a textbook of friendship.&#x201d;<b> Curtis Armstrong</b><br><br>&#x201c;If Lyndsay Faye&#x2019;s byline weren&#x2019;t on the cover, readers might deduce that the Sherlock Holmes mysteries in <i>The Whole Art of Detection</i> actually came from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

The feat that Lyndsay Faye has pulled off with The Whole Art of Detection is nothing short of amazing . . .

Faye also restores Watson to Holmes' side and allows the relationship between the detective and his biographer to mature and mellow without altering either man's essential character. It's refreshing to see Holmes be Holmes.

A big thank-you also goes to Elizabeth Bistrow and everyone at NAL who had a hand in seeing this book come to life.</p><p>Endless gratitude goes to Sharon Short, who spent hours with me at a local Panera helping me flesh out Wishcraft rules. I can only imagine what eavesdroppers may have been thinking. Next time, Sharon, the green tea is on me.</p><p>To my critique partners, who always know just what to say (even when I might not want to hear it): You&#x2019;re the best friends a girl can have.</p><p>I&#x2019;m so grateful for my family, who have always been incredibly supportive of me and my dreams. I couldn&#x2019;t do this without you. Much love.</p><p>Finally, to my readers who enthusiastically follow me&#x2014;and my characters&#x2014;wherever my books take us ... I cannot express how grateful I am. Thank you.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Usually I&#x2019;m not in the habit of tiptoeing through strange houses under the cover of darkness.</p><p>It was unsettling to say the least, and I felt completely out of sorts. My outfit only added to my discomfort. The flouncy, frilly pink satin bodysuit, tulle tutu, and pink ballet slippers were a far cry from my usual jeans and tee.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t help that my every move was being watched closely.</p><p>As I crept up the aged wooden stairs of a large house along the coast of Salem, Massachusetts, Amanda Goodwin followed behind me with her mother-�in-�law, Cherise, bringing up the rear. They&#x2019;d ushered me straight upstairs as soon as I&#x2019;d arrived, their eyes lit like they were two little girls sneaking a peek at Santa. At the top of the steps, a long hallway branched into four bedrooms, one of which had its door closed. Pink and black polka-�dotted block letters attached to the wood paneling declared it as my destination: Laurel Grace Goodwin&#x2019;s bedroom.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you done this before, Ms. Merriweather?&#x201d; Amanda asked softly, tugging on my gossamer wings. &#x201c;Played the tooth fairy?&#x201d;</p><p>I had sized up Amanda immediately as a hip suburban soccer mom, in her designer jeans, beaded tank top, and Grecian-�inspired sandals. A natural blonde, she wore her hair long and straight, parted down the middle. Lots of lip gloss and mascara but not much else.</p><p>I smiled, trying to hide my nervousness. &#x201c;Please call me Darcy, and this is my first time.&#x201d; I truly hoped it would be my last. Tulle and I didn&#x2019;t get along. My legs were itching something fierce, despite the thin protection of a pair of tights.</p><p>&#x201c;Well&#x201d;&#x2014;�Cherise had the strong Boston accent of someone who had been born and bred in this area&#x2014;�&#x201c;your aunt Velma highly recommends you, and we trust her and As You Wish implicitly.&#x201d;</p><p>I had been working at my aunt Ve&#x2019;s business, As You Wish, for only two weeks. The company blended the tasks of a virtual personal assistant and a personal concierge service. Our clients&#x2019; requests were diverse, often challenging, and sometimes just plain strange. They ranged from administrative tasks to running errands, to shopping for a gift, to providing an extra pair of hands to clean up a messy house, and much, much more. As You Wish&#x2019;s motto was that no request was too big or too small and no job �impossible&#x2014;�as was proven by the fact that I was standing before the Goodwins looking like a character from a fairy tale.</p><p>I transferred my velvet drawstring purse from one hand to the other and noticed I was leaving a trail of glitter behind me. It sparkled on the rich dark oak floors.</p><p>Short and pleasantly plump with chin-�length snow-�white hair, heavily layered and teased, Cherise wore a bit too much makeup, and overaccessorized with several ropes of beaded necklaces and heavy chandelier earrings. &#x201c;I was glad to hear of you and your sister moving in with Velma. I imagine she&#x2019;s been glad to share the <i>family business</i> with you?&#x201d;</p><p>Ve had told me that she and Cherise were old friends, though they hadn&#x2019;t spoken in a while. Even still, I wasn&#x2019;t the least bit surprised Cherise knew of my arrival to the Enchanted Village, the unique Salem neighborhood where my aunt lived.</p><p>A new witch in town doesn&#x2019;t go unnoticed in these parts.</p><p>And two new witches? Rumors were flying faster than some broomsticks.</p><p>Cherise either was fishing for a little gossip or was genuinely curious to know if my sister, Harper, and I were aware that the <i>family business</i> she referred to wasn&#x2019;t the brick-�and-�mortar As You Wish, but the fact that we could actually grant wishes through a wishing spell.</p><p>It was a reasonable inquiry. Until three weeks ago, Harper and I were living in Ohio and dealing with lives that weren&#x2019;t what we&#x2019;d imagined. When we received a note from Aunt Ve asking if she could visit because she had something important to tell us, we had no idea how our lives would change. Within a week we had packed up what little we had and moved to the Enchanted Village.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re glad to be here.&#x201d; Well, I was. Harper was still adjusting.</p><p>Putting my (disastrous) divorce and my inability to find a decent job behind me and getting Harper out of Ohio before she caused any more trouble may have been the perfect incentive to move, but learning about our heritage of the Craft, or in my family&#x2019;s case <i>Wish</i> craft, was now a priority. I was still learning the Wishcraft Laws, and all the ins and outs that came along with the revelation that I was a witch.</p><p>Thankfully some of the laws were easy to remember. Like the fact that I can&#x2019;t wish death on anyone. Or prevent death. Or interfere with true love. Or that no Wishcrafter can grant her own wishes (or other Wishcrafters&#x2019; wishes). I also can&#x2019;t solicit or refuse to grant a wish without severe consequence. However, the biggest rule of all was that I (or any Crafter for that matter) couldn&#x2019;t reveal to any mortal the truth about my powers or I risked losing my wish-�granting abilities forever.</p><p>Unfortunately, some of the laws were a little fuzzy. Like the law about wishing for money&#x2014;�granting that wish meant the money would have to be <i>taken</i> from someone else. To follow the Crafters&#x2019; basic principle of &#x201c;Do no harm,&#x201d; the Wishcrafter Laws also required that only wishes made with motives pure of heart would be granted. How that was actually determined was still a mystery to me.</p><p>Cherise pressed. &#x201c;How do you enjoy working for As You Wish?&#x201d;</p><p>The Goodwins were Curecrafters, healing witches, and were apparently quite nosy to boot. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going well,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;So far this week I&#x2019;ve tracked down sold-�out tickets to tonight&#x2019;s Boston Pops performance, created a gift basket for a basset hound recovering from surgery, searched online for an out-�of-�print romance novel, and now this.&#x201d; I gestured to my costume. I didn&#x2019;t mention anything about the Wishcrafting, and how I&#x2019;d been able to use a spell to help a client get last-�minute tickets on a sold-�out flight to Paris so he could surprise his girlfriend with a weekend getaway.</p><p>As You Wish was both popular and highly successful. Most of the requests received were accomplished through hard work and sheer determination. However, sometimes... sometimes magic was needed to get the job done right. Often, because of the name of the shop, people simply made wishes&#x2014;�which made our job a whole lot easier. Other times, seeking the help of other Crafters and <i>their</i> unique abilities gave us an edge.</p><p>But mortals, who were the majority of our clients, didn&#x2019;t know about the magic. And though the average customer wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised about something mystical happening in a place called the Enchanted Village, disclosing our family powers wasn&#x2019;t a risk Aunt Ve was willing to take, especially after having an ancestor nearly burned at the stake.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you make a lovely tooth fairy,&#x201d; Amanda said as a grandfather clock donged at the far end of the hallway.</p><p>It was nine. I had to hurry this along&#x2014;�or I&#x2019;d be late for the emergency village meeting that was due to start at nine thirty. Ve had insisted Harper and I attend. Our aunt was still introducing us around the village and was eager for us to get acclimated. She wanted nothing more than for us to put down solid roots among the other Crafters. Well, that and take over As You Wish when she retired.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you mind if I tape this?&#x201d; Cherise asked, holding up a small video camera. &#x201c;For my son? He couldn&#x2019;t be here tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t allow videotaping of our services.&#x201d; For good reason. Wishcrafters emitted a blinding glow, a white aura, on camera. Which explained, after all these years, why there weren&#x2019;t any baby pictures of Harper and me, and why every picture we were in was always &#x201c;overexposed.&#x201d;</p><p>I was surprised Cherise had asked. Didn&#x2019;t she know about the auras? I made a mental note to ask Ve how much Crafters knew about one another and their limitations. How secretive were Crafters with one another?</p><p>Cameras were definitely out. Not that I would even recognize myself right now, with all the costume makeup and glitter I was wearing. It took a lot of effort, and some amazing false eyelashes, to look fairylike.</p><p>&#x201c;Dennis was welcome to be here tonight, Cherise.&#x201d; Amanda&#x2019;s cheeks flushed. &#x201c;He declined. It&#x2019;s his loss.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s stubborn,&#x201d; Cherise said. &#x201c;You know this.&#x201d;</p><p>I tried to blend into the woodwork&#x2014;�rather hard to do when one looked a lot like a giant glittery stick of pink cotton candy. The last thing I wanted was to get involved in the middle of a family dispute. Been there, done that.</p><p>Amanda must have sensed my unease. She said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. My husband and I recently separated. I&#x2019;m sure you don&#x2019;t need all the gory details. Suffice it to say that <i>he&#x2019;s</i> the one who moved out.&#x201d;</p><p>My heart ached for her. I was much better off without my ex, but it had taken me two years to realize that.</p><p>Cherise&#x2019;s eyebrow rose. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s <i>very</i> stubborn.&#x201d;</p><p>Amanda flashed her an irritated look. &#x201c;Besides, if you recall, it&#x2019;s his fault we had to contact As You Wish in the first place.&#x201d;</p><p>As You Wish had received a frantic call from Cherise this morning, needing to hire someone to play the tooth fairy. Amanda&#x2019;s daughter, five-�year-�old Laurel Grace, had lost her first tooth, and had been excited for the tooth fairy to come&#x2014;�until her father told her there was no such thing.</p><p>Aunt Ve, who had taken the call, had somehow deemed that this was the perfect job for me to take on. I had my doubts. Especially when I saw the gossamer wings and the pink tights. Not to mention the dreadful tulle.</p><p>Cherise looked pained. She explained, &#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t thinking. Once he realized what he&#x2019;d said, he tried to convince Laurel Grace he&#x2019;d been kidding, but the damage had been done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not the first time,&#x201d; Amanda murmured.</p><p>&#x201c;I just wish...,&#x201d; Cherise began.</p><p>I sucked in a breath, waiting. My every nerve was on alert, standing on end, prickling, getting ready to react. Adrenaline surged, flowed.</p><p>&#x201c;I just wish...&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;Never mind.&#x201d;</p><p>I let out the breath I&#x2019;d been holding.</p><p>Wringing her hands, Amanda said, &#x201c;Five-�year-�olds shouldn&#x2019;t have to...</p></p><h2>Outies (Mote Series, Book 3)</h2><p>In a return to the CoDominium universe of the Second Empire of Man, Outies pauses at the fringes of human space, on an outworld that never knew fossil fuels. New Utah instead pushed crude solar technologies to the limits of everyday utility. But a planet is a big place - and it&#39;s time for the New Utahns to meet the neighbors. Blending hard science and social science, Outies explores complexities of biology, geology, and ecology at the heart of alien Motie society and evolution. While military science fiction in a sense, that sense is very much of the wars of our time. Outies plunges through the confusion, chaos, factionalism, and unpredictability of low intensity conflict with realism, but largely through civilian eyes. In a twist on traditional space opera, it introduces Asach Quinn - a wily, thoughtful, genderless, and diplomatic foil to reckless pilot Kevin Renner. Leaving the aristocratic manors of Sparta, Quinn burrows deep inside the heads of members of the Church of Him - who believe that the red dwarf visible twinkling through the Coal Sack Nebula is literally the Eye of God. Pournelle - an ex-Army intelligence officer turned anthropologist - provides New Utah and its characters with a rich sense of place and deep motivations; hints at what may become, over the next millenium, of Mormons, moties, and Earth islanders displaced by sea level rise - and even masters some Tok Pisin along the way. At nearly 110,000 words (about 400 print pages), the book is packed with additional material designed to allow the reader to explore New Utah in as much depth as desired. For those new to (or needing a refresher on) the Mote series, a detailed chronology lists key events over the five centuries preceding Outies. The cast of characters is organized by role and location, providing hints of relationships that unwind over the course of the novel. A map lays out the continental-scale environs in which the story is set. An appendix provides a guide to acronyms, details of religious history and organization, an explanation of alien accounting systems, and evolutionary biology. There is even an original musical score, composed by music theorist J. Daniel Jenkins. Outies is an authorized sequel to The Mote in God&#39;s Eye and The Gripping Hand by best-selling SF duo Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. With a fresh point of view, deep continuity, and page-turning plot twists, J.R. (Jennifer) Pournelle brings a mature generation of Moties to life for a mature generation of readers. Outies introduces new characters, adds depth to beloved old ones, creates a rich, imaginable world, and gives clear voices to aliens and outsiders.</p><p>I thought about the post-war (or was it still war?) period of 2003-2004 for a good long time after returning home from Iraq. Of the many things I pondered, one was war fiction, and especially military science fiction. War books have compelling plots, generally along the lines of: there are good guys; there are bad guys. Sometimes bad guys, that is, guys who were individually bad, redeem themselves and become heroic good guys. Anyway, the good guys win, or die valiantly trying. War's over. The End.<br><br>But nothing I saw in Iraq was ever that cut-and-dried. On any given day, it was hard to tell if, when&nbsp;and where we were having a war. It was generally impossible to tell good guys from bad guys. There were many shades of both, on both sides. Technology sometimes won the day, but seldom won the outcome. None of us outsiders, ever, knew what the locals were thinking - even if they pretended to tell us. And everything, absolutely everything, including matters of life and death, was weighed and measured by social standards and rules of conduct that we simply could not read. <br><br>That's what "first contact" stories are really about - and that's what Niven &amp; Pournelle did with <i>The Mote in God's Eye</i> some 35 years ago. So, as I thought about it, I decided: wouldn't it be interesting to try to flip that around: to get inside the heads of locals and others who had the same dilemna in reverse. I drew a lot on my Iraq experience trying to do that. <br><br>To make this a credible sequel, I took careful, detailed notes on timelines, political precedents, character traits, and technologies from Mote and <i>The Gripping Hand,</i> and tried to be excedingly careful to stick to the "realities" of that universe. But, given that the first Mote was written 35 years ago, I also wanted to update the science and gender issues that were at the core of the original novel. First, because Sally Fowler (a central character in the original book) was ostensibly an anthropologist,&nbsp;in my sequel, I brought in another anthropologist to serve as a new protagonist and&nbsp;do real anthropological things. Second, I spent a lot of&nbsp;studying reproductive biology, in order to write in backstory that made sense of the Motie's bizarre physiology. It's written up in&nbsp;the report in the Appendix. You don't have to read that, but if you are interested, you can - and if you demand more answers than are in the story itself, you should. <br><br>What I did NOT try to do was copy Niven &amp; Pournelle's style. Firstly, they are, after all, still writing and need no help from me to do that. Secondly, I wanted to get at that sense of disordered confusion - that sense of nobody being quite sure where they are, literally and figuratively, as a place teeters on the brink of&nbsp; (or of pulling back from) war. So, each chapter deals with four threads. Mentally, I think of them as:&nbsp;Imperials (and what they are up to); Church and State&nbsp;(that is, events in New Utah's capitol city, St. George); The Pale (that is, Bonneville and&nbsp;the Barrens); and Beyond the Pale (that is, the Barrens and Outback). These threads each move forward independently for awhile, but of course come together as the book goes on. In Iraq, that would be something like trying to keep track of what's going on in Washington D.C., Baghdad, Nasiriya, and the desert wastes of Dhi Qar province. From the standpoint of standing next to a single well at a roadside shrine, it's hard to grasp that those other places even exist - let alone have much relevance. But of course they do.<br><br>Finally, the ending was intended as a bit of fun, consistent with the other "remote fringe" of Second Empire space (King David's Spaceship) that launched my father's career in science fiction writing. I hope that diehard Pournelle fans who spot the premise will recognise it for what it is: an intentional homage to him. <br><br>And by the way, I expect most fans of his know this already, but he's J.E.&nbsp; I'm J.R.Since first contact with the alien Mote civilization, expansion of the Second Empire of Man has slowed. The Fleet's attention has become consumed with blocking Motie access to human space--and holding that thin line now depends upon a shaky alliance with the horrifically prolific, technologically brilliant, three-armed Moties themselves. Under the terms of Horace Bury's will, human and Motie shareholders have also assumed joint control of industrial giant Imperial Autonetics. <br><br>However, the Empire still decides the fate of worlds. Those already in possession of space-worthy craft may join as Classified systems, and enjoy the benefits of access to new technology, trading rights, and Fleet protection. Those less advanced may be parceled out as colonial concessions. Outworlds that refuse to join risk conquest by zealous commanders intent on preserving the hard-won peace at any cost. Worlds boasting great riches are targeted for quick accession. Those presenting any danger are targeted for quick destruction. Yet, though their very planets depend on guessing the right questions, and delivering the right answers, in the remote backwaters of Imperial space, few of these details are known to the Outies themselves. <br><br>Set in the first chaotic year following Horace Bury's death, this new sequel to <i>King David's Spaceship, The Mote in God's Eye,</i> and <i>The Gripping Hand</i> introduces Asach Quinn, a human character as enigmatic as the alien Moties. It shifts point of view from those engaged in the vast race across the stars, to that of the "outies" themselves.</p><h2>All Together in One Place (Kinship and Courage Series #1)</h2><p><b><i>Their lives would be tempered by adversity, expanded by faith, polished by perseverance.</i></b><br><br>Based on an actual 1852 Oregon Trail incident, <i>All Together in One Place, Book One in the Kinship and Courage series</i>, speaks to the strength in every woman and celebrates the promise of hope that unfailingly blooms amidst tragedy and challenge. <br><br>For Madison "Mazy" Bacon, a young wife living in southern Wisconsin, the future appears every bit as promising as it is reassuringly predictable.

Or she donned the same style of zoot suit that her male counterparts wore. With their striking attire, pachucos and pachucas represented a new generation of Mexican American youth, which arrived on the public scene in the 1940s. Yet while pachucos have often been the subject of literature, visual art, and scholarship, <i>The Woman in the Zoot Suit</i> is the first book focused on pachucas. <p></p><p>Two events in wartime Los Angeles thrust young Mexican American zoot suiters into the media spotlight. In the Sleepy Lagoon incident, a man was murdered during a mass brawl in August 1942. Twenty-two young men, all but one of Mexican descent, were tried and convicted of the crime. In the Zoot Suit Riots of June 1943, white servicemen attacked young zoot suiters, particularly Mexican Americans, throughout Los Angeles. The Chicano movement of the 1960s&#x2013;1980s cast these events as key moments in the political awakening of Mexican Americans and pachucos as exemplars of Chicano identity, resistance, and style. While pachucas and other Mexican American women figured in the two incidents, they were barely acknowledged in later Chicano movement narratives. Catherine S. Ram�rez draws on interviews she conducted with Mexican American women who came of age in Los Angeles in the late 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s as she recovers the neglected stories of pachucas. Investigating their relative absence in scholarly and artistic works, she argues that both wartime U.S. culture and the Chicano movement rejected pachucas because they threatened traditional gender roles. Ram�rez reveals how pachucas challenged dominant notions of Mexican American and Chicano identity, how feminists have reinterpreted la pachuca, and how attention to an overlooked figure can disclose much about history making, nationalism, and resistant identities.</p></p><p>&#34;Powerful and innovative, &#34;The Woman in the Zoot Suit&#34; will serve as a foundational text for future studies on culture, race, gender, and sexuality. Catherine S. Ramirez expertly reveals the complexities of pachuca identity, the extent of Mexican American women zoot suiters&#39; representation in and engagement with popular culture and mainstream media, and, ultimately, the ways that these young women disrupted dominant notions of U.S., Mexican American, and Chicana/o identity, nationalism, and family.&#34;--Luis Alvarez, author of &#34;The Power of the Zoot: Youth Culture and Resistance during World War II&#34;<p>Catherine S. Ram�rez is Associate Professor of American Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p></p><h2>God&#39;s Philosophers: How the Medieval World Laid the Foundations of Modern Science</h2><p>This is a powerful and a thrilling narrative history revealing the roots of modern science in the medieval world. The adjective &#39;medieval&#39; has become a synonym for brutality and uncivilized behavior. Yet without the work of medieval scholars there could have been no Galileo, no Newton and no Scientific Revolution. In &#34;God&#39;s Philosophers&#34;, James Hannam debunks many of the myths about the Middle Ages, showing that medieval people did not think the earth is flat, nor did Columbus &#39;prove&#39; that it is a sphere; the Inquisition burnt nobody for their science nor was Copernicus afraid of persecution; no Pope tried to ban human dissection or the number zero. &#34;God&#39;s Philosophers&#34; is a celebration of the forgotten scientific achievements of the Middle Ages - advances which were often made thanks to, rather than in spite of, the influence of Christianity and Islam. Decisive progress was also made in technology: spectacles and the mechanical clock, for instance, were both invented in thirteenth-century Europe. Charting an epic journey through six centuries of history, &#34;God&#39;s Philosophers&#34; brings back to light the discoveries of neglected geniuses like John Buridan, Nicole Oresme and Thomas Bradwardine, as well as putting into context the contributions of more familiar figures like Roger Bacon, William of Ockham and Saint Thomas Aquinas.</p><p>Please note that this is the United Kingdom edition of <i>The Genesis of Science: How the Christian Middle Ages Launched The Scientific Revolution</i>.&nbsp; If you are in the United States, you may wish to order <i>The Genesis of Science</i> from Amazon.com instead.James Hannam is a graduate of both Oxford and Cambridge where he studied physics and then gained a PhD in the history of science.

These life-sized dissectible wax women reclining on moth-eaten velvet cushions&#x2015;with glass eyes, strings of pearls, and golden tiaras crowning their real human hair&#x2015;were created in eighteenth-century Florence as the centerpiece of the first truly public science museum. Conceived as a means to teach human anatomy, the Venus also tacitly communicated the relationship between the human body and a divinely created cosmos; between art and science, nature and mankind. Today, she both intrigues and confounds, troubling our neat categorical divides between life and death, body and soul, effigy and pedagogy, entertainment and education, kitsch and art. The first book of its kind, <i>The Anatomical Venus</i>, by Morbid Anatomy Museum cofounder Joanna Ebenstein, features over 250 images&#x2015;many never before published&#x2015;gathered by its author from around the world. Its extensively researched text explores the Anatomical Venus within her historical and cultural context in order to reveal the shifting attitudes toward death and the body that today render such spectacles strange. It reflects on connections between death and wax, the tradition of life-sized simulacra and preserved beautiful women, the phenomenon of women in glass boxes in fairground displays, and ideas of the ecstatic, the sublime and the uncanny. <br><b>Joanna Ebenstein</b> is a multidisciplinary artist, curator, writer, lecturer and graphic designer.

But <i>The Anatomical Venus</i> also offers convincing reasons to see the startling Sleeping Beauty, lovely even with her entrails showing, as something much more significant. 'Perhaps the draw of the Anatomical Venus comes from an unspoken, intuited resolution of our own divided nature,' Ebenstein writes, 'an unconscious recognition of another avenue abandoned, in which beauty and science, religion and medicine, soul and body might be one.'

In this book, the Dalai Lama's profound knowledge is evident&#x2014;the result of extensive training. Here he shares his extraordinary insight into the human condition and what it means to be a responsible and caring person.

The exiled spiritual head of the Tibetan people, he is a Nobel Peace Laureate, a Congressional Gold Medal recipient, and a remarkable teacher and scholar who has authored over one hundred books.The Dalai Lama selects portions of this Buddhist classic on which to provide commentary. As is well suited to a commentary, this production uses two narrators: Wulstan Fletcher presents the text, which is followed by the commentary presented by James Gimian. The contrast in narrators is particularly helpful when the commentary engages in a dialogue with the text. The text is one of the primary teachings on the Buddhist path to becoming a Bodhisattva and living a life of generosity and compassion. The commentary represents teachings of the Dalai Lama as presented in a week-long retreat on the text. This audiobook is well suited to a self-study or a study group.

Connecting formative influences of the Catholic heritage with themes of love, consciences, sin, and suffering, the book helps readers appreciate what gives meaning to our lives. <br><br>The third edition has been revised throughout to help the reader better understand how to develop and apply moral wisdom in real life. It features additional examples, as well as new material on the teachings of Pope Francis. Chapters on the Ten Commandments and the teachings of Jesus have been re-worked in light of new scholarship. The book also features a new final chapter, Moral Agency, which addresses making practical decisions based on the lessons and texts from the book. Each chapter includes study questions to help readers further reflect on key themes.</p><p>James F. Keenan, SJ, is Canisius Professor of Theology and Director of The Jesuit Institute at Boston College. He is the author or editor of a number of books, including University Ethics: How Colleges Can Build and Benefit from a Culture of Ethics and The Works of Mercy: The Heart of Catholicism.Keenan's book is sharp, offering constructively critical analyses of fundamental moral theological ideas with a profound respect for the Catholic tradition. Keenan uses his own personal stories to recast moral theological ideas in ways that resonate deeply with our lives. Students and colleagues alike identify well with his struggles with moral issues. The chapters on love, sin, suffering, and mercy are extraordinary. (Dominic Colonna, Department of Theology, Lewis University)<br><br>This is a lovely book! Keenan probes his own experiences of struggle, suffering, and love, interweaving them with biblical reflection and theological analysis. He looks fault and sorrow squarely in the face, yet sustains buoyant notes of hope and commitment. The content of this book is an exercise in the virtue of its title. (Lisa Sowle Cahill, J. Donald Monan Professor of Theology, Boston College)<br><br>Imagine a book that is at once a source of profound wisdom, a systematic presentation of a moral and ethical tradition, and a 'page-turner!' This is what James Keenan's Moral Wisdom turns out to be. There is nothing facile about this volume, nothing superficial, nothing manipulative. It weaves together autobiography, the stories of others, interpretation of biblical and theological texts, and a deep understanding of what morality is and what the Roman Catholic tradition of moral theology has been and can be when it is at its best. Few will come away from reading this book without imaginative new hope, salutary appreciation for 'hard sayings,' new insight into the meaning of divine mercy, and perhaps experiences of both laughter and the 'gift of tears.' Thought-provoking and informative, opening questions and not shutting them down: here is a significant contribution to ongoing explorations of the moral life. (Margaret A. Farley, Gilbert Stark Professor of Christian Ethics, Yale University Divinity School)<br><br>Moral wisdom is hard to come by because it is so complex. Most of us strive for moral wisdom throughout our lives but never totally attain it. In this book, James F. Keenan skillfully brings together deep theological knowledge, historical lessons, acute pastoral sensitivity, broad spiritual experiences, and true prudence in proposing moral wisdom for Christian life and spirituality today. (Charles E. Curran, Elizabeth Scurlock University Professor of Human Values, Southern Methodist University)<br><br>James Keenan puts 'flesh and bones' on the abstractions of moral theory and demonstrates from his own personal experience how the Christian moral life is a pilgrimage of faith, hope, and love. Keenan's book will be used widely in college classrooms and seminaries alike. His clarity, honesty, and passion ought to be emulated by every moral theologian. (Stephen J. Pope, Boston College)<br><br>This third edition of Keenan's work demonstrates ever more clearly that it is not a book about moral wisdom but a book of moral wisdom. With an appealing blend of personal stories, Catholic moral theology, and insightful interpretation of human experience, Keenan's volume continues to be a welcome resource for teachers and students. (Kenneth Himes, OFM, Boston College)<br><br>Keenan is a master at conveying the dynamism of Catholic moral thought, weaving together theological scholarship with autobiography and the arts. He is without peer in his ability to teach through story, revealing the tradition to be nimble, nuanced, and capable of disclosing readers&#x2019; own inner lives. Keenan&#x2019;s magnificence as a teacher shines brightly through the pages of this third edition, and students of the text will reap profound benefits to both their intellect and their humanity. (Kathryn Getek Soltis, Villanova University)<br><br>Father James Keenan is one of those rare contemporary theologians who compellingly weaves together rich pastoral experience and masterful intellectual inquiry. To read him is to hear not only the considered wisdom of Catholic moral teaching, but to have the privilege of hearing a learned man struggling to work out his own moral practices. In this book, lay readers and scholars alike can see how Catholic moral tradition informs a life of discernment, love, and everyday courage.

Through the eyes of the ship's scholar-naturalist, Erasmus Darwin Wells, we encounter the <em>Narwhal</em>'s crew, its commander, and the far-north culture of the Esquimaux. In counterpoint, we meet the women left behind in Philadelphia, explorers only in imagination. Together, those who travel and those who stay weave a web of myth and mystery, finally discovering what they had not sought, the secrets of their own hearts.</p> 16 steel engravings and one map</p><p>In Andrea Barrett's extraordinary novel of Arctic and personal exploration, maps are deceitful, ice all-powerful, and reputation more important than truth or human lives. When the <i>Narwhal</i> sets sail from Philadelphia in May 1855, its ostensible goal is to find the crew of a long-vanished expedition--or at least their relics--and be home before winter. Of course, if the men can chart new coasts and stock up on specimens en route, so much the better. And then there's the keen prospect of selling their story, fraught with danger and discovery, to a public thirsting for excitement. Zeke Voorhees, the <i>Narwhal</i>'s young commander, is so handsome that he makes women stare and men "hum with envy"--perhaps not the best qualification for his post--but he seems loved by all. Only his brother-in-law-to-be, a naturalist, quietly mistrusts him, though he's determined to stand by the youth for his sister Lavinia's sake. At 40, eternal low-profiler Erasmus Darwin Wells has one disastrous expedition behind him and is praying for another scientific chance. He is, however, familiar with the physical risks they're taking, as well as the "long stretches when nothing happened except that one's ties to home were imperceptibly dissolved and one became a stranger to one's life."<p> And what of the women left behind? Lavinia knows little of the dangers of ice (though she's well schooled in isolation) and lives only for Zeke's return. Her companion, Alexandra Copeland, is less sanguine. Even after she's been given a secret career break--ghosting for an ailing engraver--she knows how invisible she is and how threatening her family's "dense net of obligations" will always be. Though they get less page time, Barrett is in fact as concerned with these women as she is with her seafarers. Like the heroines of her National Book Award-winning <i>Ship Fever</i>, who bump up against science and history in which only men's triumphs are written, they must somehow escape social tyranny or retreat into the consolations of storytelling or silence.</p><p> There is tyranny on board the <i>Narwhal</i> as well, as Zeke alternates between good will and paranoia, his closest companion an arctic fox he has "civilized" and who sits on his shoulder "like a white epaulet." (Alas, Sabine, like many of the men, is not to survive the journey.) Encounters with the Esquimaux--who might know more about the lost expedition than they're willing to share--not having gone according to plan, Zeke determines in late August to head for Smith Sound rather than home, despite the crew's protests. By mid-September, however, the craft is ice-locked, and it's clear they'll have to "winter over." At first the men make the best of their situation, magically sculpting cottages, castles, palaces, even a whale--and offering informal seminars in butchery, Bible studies, and basic navigation. However, as the weather worsens and Zeke grows increasingly despotic, morale plummets.</p><p> Barrett excels in both physical and social description, writing with a naturalist's precision and a passionate imagination. With quick strokes (backed up by intense research), she can fill us in on some sensible but threatening Esquimaux footgear: "All five were dressed in fur jackets and breeches, with high boots made from the leg skins of white bears. The men's feet, Erasmus saw, were sheltered by the bears' feet, with claws protruding like overgrown human toenails. Walking, the men left bear prints on the snow." The author also shines in panoramic scenes--her descriptions of the Arctic can only be called magnificent--and in small, precarious, personal moments. When Erasmus eventually returns to Philadelphia, minus his toes and his future brother-in-law, a grieving Lavinia takes to her bed. Eventually, however, she relents: "Lavinia stared straight ahead. Straight at Erasmus, her right hand tucked in her lap while her left turned a silver spoon back to front, front to back, the reflections melting, re-forming, and melting again.... Lavinia said softly, 'I forgive you.' Everyone knew she was speaking to Erasmus."</p><p> <i>The Voyage of the Narwhal</i> is full of blood-freezing surprises, a score of indelible characters, and heart-stopping mysteries. As Erasmus watches Alexandra draw landscapes he has seen before but missed something in, each pencil stroke is "like a chisel held to a cleavage plane: tap, tap, and the rock split into two sharp pieces, the world cracked and spoke to him." Readers of Andrea Barrett's novel will experience this sensation again and again. Packed with harsh truths about the not-always-true art of discovery, it is also among the most emotionally wrenching, subtle works of the century. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>&#34;The Voyage of the Narwhal&#34; has been named a 1999 American Library Association Notable Fiction Book, selected for the significant contribution to the expansion of knowledge and for the pleasure provided to adult readers.</p><h2>The Provenance Press Guide to the Wiccan Year: A Year Round Guide to Spells, Rituals, and Holiday Celebrations</h2><p>In <i>The Provenance Press Guide to the Wiccan Year</i>, Judy Ann Nock offers you a definitive guide to "the wheel of the year."

It was, they all said, a perfect day to be on the water. They did not say it was a perfect day to be in a boat, or to be out sailing. No: a perfect day to be on the water, as if it was their motto or something. And they were all so jolly and brisk, smiling in a smug, self-satisfied way that set his teeth on edge. Unlike him, they knew what they were doing, the wind-burned men in yachting caps and khaki shorts and shapeless sweaters playing at being old sea dogs, and their loud-voiced, leathery wives&#x2014;sea bitches, he thought, with a twinge of bleak amusement. He did not belong here, among these sailing folk with their lazy expertise; he knew it, and they knew it, too, which meant they had to behave twice as heartily towards him, though he could see that look in their eyes, that gleam of merry contempt.<br>It was June, and although it had rained every day the first week of the holiday, this morning was sunny and warm with not a breath of wind. The tide was high and the water in the bay had a sluggish, swollen look, the surface oily with streaks of sapphire and pink and petrol blue. He tried not to think of what was below the surface, of the murk down there, the big-eyed fish nosing along, and things with claws scuttling around on the bottom, fighting in slow motion, devouring each other. Victor Delahaye had brought the jeep round to the front of the house that morning and they had rattled the ten miles over the mountain road to Slievemore Bay in silence. Going for a sail was the last thing Davy wanted to do, but it had not been possible to refuse. &#x201c;You can crew for me,&#x201d; Delahaye had said the night before, in Sweeney&#x2019;s bar, and everyone had laughed, for some reason, everyone except Delahaye himself, and Delahaye&#x2019;s wife, who had looked at Davy narrow-eyed with that smile of hers and said nothing. And so here he was, about to venture out against his will on this frighteningly calm and innocent-seeming sea.<br>The Clancys and the Delahayes had been close for as long as anyone could remember. Samuel Delahaye and Philip Clancy had gone into partnership together at the turn of the century, running coal boats from Wales; later Samuel Delahaye had spotted the potential of the motorcar and the partners had opened one of the first big garages in the country, hiring in mechanics from England, France, Italy. The business had flourished. Although the founders were supposedly in equal partnership, everyone knew from the start that Samuel Delahaye was the boss and Phil Clancy merely his manager. Phil&#x2014;poor Phil, as people were inclined to say&#x2014;was not of an assertive disposition, and had quietly accepted his inferior role. Now Samuel&#x2019;s son, Victor, was in charge of the firm, and Phil Clancy&#x2019;s son, Jack, was supposedly his partner, but it was still as it had been in the old days, with Delahaye in charge and Clancy his second-in-command. Unlike his father before him, Jack Clancy resented his subordinate position&#x2014;resented it deeply, though he tried hard, and mostly with success, not to let his dissatisfaction show.<br>But a Clancy could not say no to a Delahaye, that was understood, which was why Davy Clancy had only smiled and shrugged when in Sweeney&#x2019;s the previous night Victor Delahaye, on the way to getting drunk and with a soiled look in his eye, had leaned over the table and invited him to come out for a sail in the Quicksilver. Davy knew nothing about boats, but everyone had laughed, and someone had clapped him on the shoulder, and what could he do but say yes, thanks, sure, and bury his nose in his glass? &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Delahaye had said, smiling tightly and showing his teeth, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pick you up at nine,&#x201d; and sauntered back to the bar. And that was when Delahaye&#x2019;s wife had looked over at Davy with that thin-lipped, mocking smile.<br>The two families spent their holidays together every summer; it was a tradition that went back to Phil and Samuel&#x2019;s time. Davy could not understand why his parents still carried it on. Old Phil was gaga now and in a nursing home, and Samuel Delahaye was in a wheelchair, and although Davy&#x2019;s father and Victor Delahaye kept up the pretense of friendship, it was an open secret how bad relations were between them, while Mona Delahaye, Victor&#x2019;s young wife&#x2014;his second, the first wife having died&#x2014;had barely a civil word to throw to Davy&#x2019;s downtrodden mother. Yet every summer the whole gang of them decamped for the month of June to Ashgrove, the Delahayes&#x2019; big stone house halfway up the back slope of Slievemore. The place had ten or twelve bedrooms, more than enough to accommodate Victor Delahaye and his wife and their grown-up twin sons Jonas and James, as well as Victor&#x2019;s unmarried sister, Marguerite&#x2014;Maggie&#x2014;and the three Clancys. This year there was an extra guest, Jonas Delahaye&#x2019;s girlfriend, Tanya Somers. Tanya, a student at Trinity College, cut so provocative a figure in her one-piece black bathing suit that the men in the party, except her boyfriend and, of course, Jack Clancy, hardly dared allow themselves to look at her, a thing that added to the tension in an already tense household.<br>This morning the little harbor was crowded with boats, their owners&#x2019; voices sounding sharp and clear across the lifeless surface of the sea amid the snap of ropes and the clink of brass fittings. Victor Delahaye was greeted warmly on all sides&#x2014;he was commodore of Slievemore Sailing Club this season&#x2014;but he hardly responded. He seemed preoccupied, and the flesh between his heavy black eyebrows was knotted in a fixed frown. Davy supposed he had a hangover. Delahaye wore sandals and tailored white trousers and a sailor&#x2019;s dark blue cotton shirt, and the rakish blue sailor&#x2019;s cap that he had brought back from a business trip to Greece. He had a tanned, craggy face that wore well its forty-something years. Walking dutifully behind him, Davy felt everyone must know him for the hopeless landlubber that he was.<br>The Quicksilver was moored at the end of the stone jetty, its sails furled. Seen close up, it did not look at all like a toy, but had the sleekly menacing lines of a giant white swordfish. Delahaye stepped nimbly down to the deck, but Davy hung back. He remembered being told once by a science teacher&#x2014;Harkins it was, a Christian Brother, the one who had been sent away for interfering with the boys in the junior classes&#x2014;that you could move a vessel as big as an oceangoing liner with just a push of one hand against the hull. He was supposed to be impressed, but the thought of such a huge thing being susceptible to the force of a boy&#x2019;s hand had filled him with dismay. Delahaye was already unwinding the mooring rope from the bollard. Sure enough, when Davy put his foot to the deck he felt the whole boat tilt a fraction, and his innards heaved. The contrast between the solid stone of the jetty underfoot and the boat&#x2019;s ponderous buoyancy made him giddy. He would probably be seasick, he thought gloomily, and saw himself hanging over the side, heaving and retching, while Delahaye stood above him with his fists on his hips, smiling in that cold fierce way, showing his teeth.<br>Davy had wondered how the boat would be made to go, since there was no wind, but now Delahaye went to the back&#x2014;the stern&#x2014;and started up the outboard engine there. That there was an engine seemed to Davy a kind of cheating, and the thought bucked him up a bit. But then the boat yawed out from the jetty and swept in a tight turn on the oily water and he had to grab for the rail to keep from being thrown off his feet. Delahaye stood at the wheel, with his cap over his eyes and his jaw squarely set, looking like Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab. Once again Davy pondered the question of why he was here, aboard this boat that had seemed so large, tethered to the jetty, and that now felt as if it were made of balsa wood, skimming towards the broad and desolate horizon. He thought he might know why, and hoped he was wrong.<br>The speed surprised him. In a few minutes they had cleared the headland and turned towards the open sea. Delahaye was all business now, shutting off the engine and unfurling the sails and pulling on cords and lashing ropes to those brass things on the deck. There was a good breeze out here, and the surface of the sea had begun pricking up everywhere in dancing white points. Davy sat on a bench at the back&#x2014;the stern, the stern!&#x2014;and tried to keep out of the way. He might as well not have been there, as far as Delahaye was concerned. A black bird with a long neck flew past in a straight swift line a foot above the surface of the sea&#x2014;where was it going to, in such a hurry and so determinedly? The big sails shivered and rattled and then suddenly the wind filled them and at once the boat bounded forward, lifting its pointed front&#x2014;the prow, he told himself, the prow was what it was called&#x2014;as if it would take to the air. Davy closed his eyes, but that made him feel dizzy and he opened them again and fixed his gaze miserably on the swaying horizon. Everything was straining forward now, the mast and sails tensed like a cocked crossbow and the water slapping and sucking at the boards. He supposed they were not doing more than fifteen or twenty miles an hour&#x2014;knots: are knots the same as miles?&#x2014;but it felt as if they were going at an impossible speed, surging over the little waves and seeming barely to hold to the surface. His hands on either side were gripping the bench so hard his fingers had begun to ache. Delahaye, satisfied that everything was set just so, pushed past him, going towards the back of the boat, and Davy caught his smell: salt, sweat, aftershave, and something else, something sharp, sour, b...</p><h2>Supergirl Vol. 3: Sanctuary (The New 52)</h2><p>Completing the H'EL ON EARTH crossover event that had made its way through Superman, Superboy and finally Supergirl.<br><br>When a mysterious Kryptonian arrives on Earth and convinces Kara that he intends on returning them to Krypton, prior to its destruction, in an effort to save the planet.&nbsp; When presented with the opportunity to return home, the young and sometimes foolish Kara fails to see H'el's whole plan, a plan that will leave the Earth in ruins.&nbsp; Wonder Woman and The Flash must facedown Kara in an effort to make her see the truth and save Earth before it's too late!<br><br>Collects issues #13-20.</p><p>Michael Green and Mike Johnson are a writing team, whose previous works include writing for television and comic books.

This would be a fateful event for her, for the results of that interrogation would decide whether or not she would be imprisoned. <br>Jeanne Guyon made the decision to present to Bossuet a clear statement - and defense - of her teachings. The result was a massive three-volume work entitled Justifications. <br>This work was later printed in French, probably appearing in only one printing. Justifications has never appeared in English, and has been virtually forgotten. Final Steps in Christian Maturity is a careful selection of some of the very best material found in that original three-volume work.

Born to an American mother and a Japanese father, Noguchi never felt like he belonged anywhere and spent his life assembling identities in his statues, monuments, and gardens. He traveled incessantly from New York to remote Japanese islands, from Paris to Bangladesh, synthesizing aesthetic values. The result--massive sculptures of interlocking wood, Zen-like gardens of granite, and stone slides--is now seen as a powerful artistic link between East and West.</p><p>Drawing on Noguchi's personal correspondence and interviews with artists, patrons, assistants, and lovers, Hayden Herrera creates another compulsively readable biography of one of the twentieth century's most important artists. Noguchi was elusive, forever uprooting himself to reinvigorate what he called the "keen edge of originality." Yet Herrera locates this man in his friendships with artists like Buckminster Fuller and Arshile Gorky, and in his affairs with women like Frida Kahlo. Herrera reveals his playfulness and his intense immersion in his work, from designing sets for Martha Graham to creating the Noguchi Museum in Queens.</p><p>A rich meditation on art in a globalized milieu, <i>Listening to Stone </i>is a moving portrait of an artist compulsively driven to reinvent himself as he searched for his own "essence of sculpture."</p></p><p>Hayden Herrera is the author of the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;nominated <i>Arshile Gorky: His Life and Work</i>, as well as <i>Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo </i>and <i>Matisse: A Portrait</i>.<p>&#x201c;The genius of <i>Listening to Stone </i>is how its author, Hayden Herrera, inhabits the sculpturing hand of its subject.

From the mountainous coast of rural Japan to bohemian New York in the 1920s to Paris and Tokyo in the following decade, she vividly presents Noguchi's relationship with his settings.

In <b>Samuel Pepys</b><i>,</i> Claire Tomalin offers us a fully realized and richly nuanced portrait of this man, whose inadvertent masterpiece would establish him as the greatest diarist in the English language.<br><br>Against the backdrop of plague, civil war, and regicide, with John Milton composing diplomatic correspondence for Oliver Cromwell, Christopher Wren drawing up plans to rebuild London, and Isaac Newton advancing the empirical study of the world around us, Tomalin weaves a breathtaking account of a figure who has passed on to us much of what we know about seventeenth-century London. We witness Pepys&#x2019;s early life and education, see him advising King Charles II before running to watch the great fire consume London, learn about the great events of the day as well as the most intimate personal details that Pepys encrypted in the Diary, follow him through his later years as a powerful naval administrator, and come to appreciate how Pepys&#x2019;s singular literary enterprise would in many ways prefigure our modern selves. With exquisite insight and compassion, <b>Samuel Pepys</b> captures the uniquely fascinating figure whose legacy lives on more than three hundred years after his death.</p><p>&#x201c;A magnificent triumph. . . . Absolutely stunning.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Atlantic Monthly<br><br></i>&#x201c;Invaluable. . . . [Tomalin] not only brings [Pepys] back to vibrant life, but makes a powerful case that he&#x2019;s more central, more &#x2018;relevant,&#x2019; than we ever imagined.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>&#x201c;A magisterial book [written] with an elegance and concision that few historians could match. . . . You have to love Samuel Pepys. He is us.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle<br><br></i>&#x201c;Exceptional. . . . Nuanced, moving. . . . A book teeming, like the diary, with clarity, momentum and great pleasure.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune<br><br></i>&#x201c;Exemplary. . . . The perfect bookend to [Pepys&#x2019;s] own rollicking self-portrait.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times<br><br></i>&#x201c;Fine and engrossing. . . .

Remarkable and sympathetic. . . .

This new systematic conception and presentation of the evidence differs in three ways from Hermann Diels&#x2019;s groundbreaking work, as well as from later editions: it renders explicit the material&#x2019;s thematic organization; it includes a selection from such related bodies of evidence as archaic poetry, classical drama, and the Hippocratic corpus; and it presents an overview of the reception of these thinkers until the end of antiquity.</p><p> Volume I contains introductory and reference materials essential for using all other parts of the edition. Volumes II&#x2013;III include chapters on ancient doxography, background, and the Ionians from Pherecydes to Heraclitus. Volumes IV&#x2013;V present western Greek thinkers from the Pythagoreans to Hippo. Volumes VI&#x2013;VII comprise later philosophical systems and their aftermath in the fifth and early fourth centuries. Volumes VIII&#x2013;IX present fifth-century reflections on language, rhetoric, ethics, and politics (the so-called sophists and Socrates) and conclude with an appendix on philosophy and philosophers in Greek drama.</p></p><p><p>Andr� Laks is Professor Emeritus of Ancient Philosophy at the University of Paris&#x2013;Sorbonne, and Professor of Ancient Philosophy at the Universidad Panamericana, Mexico City.</p><p>Glenn W.

And spending a few months doing so gives the reader almost all that she needs (perhaps along with Loeb #258, <i>Greek Elegiac Poetry</i>) to reconstruct for herself the origins of the discipline of philosophy.

The author of many literary novels and stories in practically every genre, his novels have won and been shortlisted for numerous awards including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Whitbread and Guardian Fiction Prize. In 1999, he was given the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award; in 2001, he was inducted into the SF Hall of Fame; and in 2007, he was named a SFWA Grandmaster. Michael Moorcock is also a musician who has performed since the seventies with his own band, the Deep Fix; and, as a member of the prog rock band, Hawkwind, won a gold disc. His tenure as editor of New Worlds magazine in the sixties and seventies is seen as the high watermark of SF editorship in the UK, and was crucial in the development of the SF New Wave. Michael Moorcock&#39;s literary creations include Hawkmoon, Corum, Von Bek, Jerry Cornelius and, of course, his most famous character, Elric. He has been compared to, among others, Balzac, Dumas, Dickens, James Joyce, Ian Fleming, J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard. Although born in London, he now splits his time between homes in Texas and Paris.</p><h2>Never Change</h2><p>A self-anointed spinster at fifty-one, Myra Lipinski is reasonably content with her quiet life, her dog, Frank, and her career as a visiting nurse. But everything changes when Chip Reardon, the golden boy she adored in high school, is assigned as her new patient. Choosing to forgo treatment for an incurable illness, Chip has returned to his New England hometown to spend what time he has left. Now, Myra and Chip find themselves engaged in a poignant redefinition of roles, and a complicated dance of memory, ambivalence, and longing.</p><p>Elizabeth Berg has a single great gift as a novelist. She creates heroines who are stuck and unhappy, yet deeply sympathetic. This may seem like an easy trick to pull off, but it's not. Think about it: usually when a character is mired in a problem--especially a problem stemming from her own reluctance to change, or fear of commitment, or lack of identity--the reader is ready within a few dozen pages to shout, "Pull yourself together!" and set the book aside. In contrast, Berg's characters seem like enjoyable challenges: problems with actual solutions.<p> In <i>Never Change</i>, Berg uses her gift to great advantage. Middle-aged Myra Lipinsky describes herself as "the one who sat on a folding chair out in the hall with a cigar box on my lap selling tickets to the prom, but never going." And despite a flourishing career as a visiting nurse, she feels as much an also-ran as ever. As the novel begins, in fact, high school seems to be rearing its ugly head again: Chip Reardon, the heartthrob of Myra's youth, has returned to town to live with his parents. Chip is dying from a brain tumor, and Myra becomes his nurse. Berg is not the kind of writer to lay bare the unsettling power dynamics of such a situation. Instead, Chip and Myra become friends and, well, learn how to love each other. It's a testament to the author's strong sense of character that we actually believe--and what's more, care about--Myra's emergence from her emotional cocoon. And the book is full of nice details, like this snapshot of children being read to at a library, "rising up on their knees to see the pictures, resting their hands unselfconsciously on those ahead of them so that they would not lose their balance." Such careful observations, recounted in Myra's voice, make us believe that she is a character worth knowing, and worth saving. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p><b>Elizabeth Berg</b> is the author of ten national bestselling novels, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>True to Form,</i> <i>Never Change,</i> and <i>Open House,</i> which was an Oprah's Book Club selection in 2000. <i>Durable Goods</i> and <i>Joy School</i> were selected as American Library Association Best Books of the Year, and <i>Talk Before Sleep</i> was short-listed for the ABBY award in 1996.

One of the most impressive answers has been the axiomatic development of set theory. The question raised is: "Exactly what assumptions, beyond those of elementary logic, are required as a basis for modern mathematics?" Answering this question by means of the Zermelo-Fraenkel system, Professor Suppes' coverage is the best treatment of axiomatic set theory for the mathematics student on the upper undergraduate or graduate level. <br>The opening chapter covers the basic paradoxes and the history of set theory and provides a motivation for the study. The second and third chapters cover the basic definitions and axioms and the theory of relations and functions. Beginning with the fourth chapter, equipollence, finite sets and cardinal numbers are dealt with. Chapter five continues the development with finite ordinals and denumerable sets. Chapter six, on rational numbers and real numbers, has been arranged so that it can be omitted without loss of continuity. In chapter seven, transfinite induction and ordinal arithmetic are introduced and the system of axioms is revised. The final chapter deals with the axiom of choice. Throughout, emphasis is on axioms and theorems; proofs are informal. Exercises supplement the text. Much coverage is given to intuitive ideas as well as to comparative development of other systems of set theory. Although a degree of mathematical sophistication is necessary, especially for the final two chapters, no previous work in mathematical logic or set theory is required. <br>For the student of mathematics, set theory is necessary for the proper understanding of the foundations of mathematics. Professor Suppes in <i>Axiomatic Set Theory </i>provides a very clear and well-developed approach. For those with more than a classroom interest in set theory, the historical references and the coverage of the rationale behind the axioms will provide a strong background to the major developments in the field. 1960 edition.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State and Law and Order</h2><p>This special 35th anniversary edition contains the original unchanged text that inspired a generation alongside two new chapters that explore the books continued significance for todays readers The Preface provides a brief retrospective account of the books original structure the rich ethnographic intellectual and theoretical work that informed it and the historical context in which it appeared In the new Afterword each of the authors takes up a specific theme from the original book and interrogates it in the light of current crises perspectives and contexts</p><p>Stuart Hall is one of the founding figures of the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies, was formerly President of the BSA (1995-97) and is now Professor Emeritus at the Open University, UK.

This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> looks at the Devil in the history of ideas and in the lives of real people. Darren Oldridge shows us that the Devil is an important figure in western history--a richly complex and contradictory one. Oldridge focuses on three main themes: the idea of the Devil being integral to western thought from the early Middle Ages to the beginnings of modernity; the belief that the Devil represents the mirror image of goodness; and the multiplicity and instability of ideas about the Devil. Oldridge concludes by exploring "demonological" ways of thinking in our own time, including allegations of "satanic ritual abuse."<br></p><p><br><strong>Darren Oldridge</strong> is a Senior Lecturer in History at the University of Worcester.<br>In this densely researched and drily elegant book, Satan is pursued through Augustine, Marlowe, Milton, Shelley, Blake, Goethe, Ambrose Bierce, Auden and CS Lewis&#39;s Screwtape, tales of self-mortification and witch-hunting, painting and the cinema. * Steven Poole, The Guardian * Devil believer or devil-denier, you&#39;ll find plenty to get your teeth into here. * Northern Echo * This book may appeal to those wanting a short but insightful survey of those understandings of evil that the devil represents. * Reform Magazine *</p><h2>Estates in Land and Future Interests: A Step-by-Step Guide (Aspen Coursebook)</h2><p><p>The fifth edition of<em> Estates in Land and Future Interests</em> combines graphics, text boxes, and pedagogical techniques especially helpful to visual learners to teach the basics of estates and future interests, a particularly confusing subset of first-year property.

With definitions of concepts at their disposal, students learn the rules of logical inference, read and understand proofs of theorems, and write their own proofs--all while becoming familiar with the grammar of mathematics and its style. In addition, they will develop an appreciation of the different methods of proof (contradiction, induction), the value of a proof, and the beauty of an elegant argument. The authors emphasize that mathematics is an ongoing, vibrant discipline--its long, fascinating history continually intersects with territory still uncharted and questions still in need of answers. The authors&#39; extensive background in teaching mathematics shines through in this balanced, explicit, and engaging text, designed as a primer for higher-level mathematics courses. They elegantly demonstrate process and application and recognize the byproducts of both the achievements and the missteps of past thinkers. Chapters 1-5 introduce the fundamentals of abstract mathematics and chapters 6-8 apply the ideas and techniques, placing the earlier material in a real context. Readers&#39; interest is continually piqued by the use of clear explanations, practical examples, discussion and discovery exercises, and historical comments.</p><p>Robert J.

Arguing that this folk discourse emerged in response to economic and political restructuring in the Delta during the twentieth century, he goes on to show how it constitutes a critique of the plantation South, New South modernization, and the transformation of capitalist agriculture during the so-called Green Revolution.

Recent interest in such issues as feminism, spirituality, parenting, and ecumenism, however, force a serious reexamination of Mary's place in Protestant faith. In <i>Blessed One</i>, widely respected Protestant scholars seek to answer three basic questions: who is Mary? how does Mary's story intersect with contemporary life? and what does Mary teach us about God? This thoughtful and highly accessible book will be of great interest to all engaged in the debates of the contemporary church, Protestants and Roman Catholics alike.</p><p>Contributors include Nancy Duff, Beverly Roberts Gaventa, Joel Green, E.

Why is love so often associated with tragedy, she asks. Why are our experiences of pleasure so often shadowed by loss? And can we change these patterns?<br><br>Gilligan observes children at play and adult couples in therapy and discovers that the roots of a more hopeful view of love are all around us. She finds evidence in new psychological research and traces a path leading from the myth of Psyche and Cupid through Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays and Freud&#x2019;s case histories, to Anne Frank&#x2019;s diaries and contemporary novels. Groundbreaking and immensely readable, <b>The Birth of Pleasure</b> has powerful implications for the way we live and love.</p><p>A psychologist's fine-tuned ear and a scholar's penchant for illuminating key ideas with precise literary citations enable Carol Gilligan to trace love's path in <i>The Birth of Pleasure</i>. Her extensive research on children's communications and couples in crisis has revealed a rather disturbing truism: a child's inborn ability to love freely and live authentically gets thoroughly squelched by patriarchal structures. She shows how daughters' voices are systematically quieted, sons are shamed into masculinity, and those who pursue "inappropriate" knowledge or rapacious expressions are punished. <p> At the core of her study lies the timeless myth of Psyche and Cupid, a richly allegorical tale of passion and resistance to patriarchal norms. By meticulously interpreting this triumph, Gilligan challenges the standard "foundational stories" embraced by Western civilization (including the Book of Genesis, <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i>, and <i>The Orestia</i>). Satisfying excerpts from dozens of authors flow easily alongside Gilligan's dialogues with couples, adolescent girls, and preschool boys. Clearly, her analysis of Anne Frank's diary--all three editions--provides Gilligan's best illustration of one's initiation into patriarchal tunnel vision. She credits many colleagues, students, and seminar and symposium attendees for fleshing out all parts of this lovingly crafted text; but her own ear for truth makes its message resonate. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p>&#x201c;Compelling . . . a thrilling new paradigm.&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;The Times Literary Supplement<br><br></i>&#x201c;Here is human connection thoughtfully considered by one of our finest psychological and social observers.

He found his tribe in New York's East Village, a neighborhood noted in the 1970s and '80s for drugs, blight, and a burgeoning art scene. His creativity spilled out in paintings, photographs, films, texts, installations, and in his life and its recounting-creating a sort of mythos around himself. His circle of East Village artists moved into the national spotlight just as the AIDS plague began its devastating advance, and as right-wing culture warriors reared their heads. As Wojnarowicz's reputation as an artist grew, so did his reputation as an agitator-because he dealt so openly with his homosexuality, so angrily with his circumstances as a Person With AIDS, and so fiercely with his would-be censors.</p><p><i>Fire in the Belly</i> is the untold story of a polarizing figure at a pivotal moment in American culture-and one of the most highly acclaimed biographies of the year.</p></p><p><b>Cynthia Carr </b>was a columnist and arts reporter for the <i>Village Voice </i>from 1984 to 2003. Writing under the byline C. Carr, she specialized in experimental and cutting-edge art, especially performance art. Some of these pieces are now collected in <i>On Edge: Performance at the End of the Twentieth Century</i>. She is also the author of <i>Our Town: A Heartland Lynching, a Haunted Town, and the Hidden History of White America</i>. Her work has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Artforum</i>, <i>Bookforum</i>, <i>Modern Painters</i>, the <i>Drama Review</i>, and other publications. She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2007. Carr lives in New York.<p>&#x201c;[Fire in the Belly is] unimprovable as a biography&#x2013;thorough, measured, beautifully written, loving but not uncritical -- as a concentrated history of his times, and as a memorial, presenting him in his entirety, twenty years dead but his ardor uncooled.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Luc Sante, Bookforum</b></p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;It is no small achievement that Carr, who first met the artist when he was part of the East Village art scene of the early &#x2018;80s, shortly before she began writing for the Village Voice, has managed to portray&nbsp; [Wojnarowicz] in remarkably rich dimensions.... Carr&#x2019;s detailed research into Wojnarowicz&#x2019;s days and nights, friends and fall-outs, hook-ups, loves, losses, travels, homeless stretches, intimate connections...and eventual sickness and death is both heartbreaking and unflinchingly honest. Carr has managed to create not only an essential biography but required reading for anyone interested in the &#x2018;80s art world.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Christopher Bollen, Interview</b></p><p>&#x201c;A compelling picture of a time in New York that has now completely vanished, when an existence devoted to art, on the margins, was still possible, and not necessarily something to be romanticized.... The picture of East Village culture that Carr offers&#x2014;she covered it for years as a reporter for the Village Voice&#x2014;&nbsp;is alone worth the price of the book. Despite her friendship with Wojnarowicz in the last months of his life, Carr is willing to paint the artist in clear-eyed prose, balancing unflattering stories of drug use and success-induced paranoia with those of his trenchant and harrowing AIDS activism and defense of freedom of expression. (The intricate details of his battle with right-wing critics will, one hopes, provide fodder for today&#x2019;s protestors.)&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Andrew Russeth, Modern Painters</b></p><p>&#x201c;Thanks to Carr&#x2019;s meticulous portrait, [Wojnarowicz&#x2019;s] work again feels primal, magicked away from the bluster of whatever controversies it provoked. We come away from a book like this with a keen sense of life&#x2019;s strangeness and haste, its abuses and beauty, its ultimately terrible vanishing.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jeremy Lybarger, <b>The Brooklyn Rail</b></p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Biographers often have an uncommon knack for describing even the most fascinating individuals and incidents with the dullest possible prose, boring the reader with the most uninteresting childhood details and rushing the parts that matter. Carr doesn't make such mistakes. At almost 600 pages, her book is monumental, yet somehow it feels concise. She uses short, clear sentences throughout, successfully invoking complicated events and their implications with a staccato grace. While she doesn't depart from the conventional linear structure of the biography, she inhabits it with a vitality so often lacking.... thankfully Carr reveals the contradictions and complications of [Wojnarowicz&#x2019;s] life, an important task of any successful biographer.... Fire in the Belly is an impressive work that clearly took years to make.... Carr breaks free of one of the most deadening strictures of the conventional biography: she enters herself not just into the narrative, but into the life of the person she is investigating. While this first meeting happens by chance, and only results in a casual acquaintanceship, Carr&#x2019;s simple act of disclosure allows for the most intimate parts of the book. Fire in the Belly centers around the life of Wojnarowicz, but it also serves as an unofficial history of 1970s and 1980s West Village gay life (and the West Side piers in particular), the emergence of AIDS, the East Village art scene of the 1980s (most extensively), and the censorship wars of the late-&#x2018;80s and early-&#x2018;90s.... In some ways this book serves as an elegy for a culture of artists in downtown New York ravaged by AIDS.... This is not just a story about an explosive artist who led a tumultuous life, or even an explosive artist and his equally dynamic and equally complicated friends. It's a story about &#x2018;us&#x2019;.... not just a tender biography of one brazen individual but an intimate text displaying the possibilities of connection in the face of adversity.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore, Bookslut</b></p><p>&#x201c;A prodigious chronicle....

Carr knew David Wojnarowicz (1954&#x2013;92), the controversial creator of the art film A Fire in My Belly, and she bears him witness in this politically charged look at his life. Using her skills as a reporter, Carr has pieced together this moving though unsentimental tribute from interviews with friends, candid conversations with Wojnarowicz before his death, and his own deep and provocative writings. She also discusses the politics then and now that dominate the so-called culture wars. An up-close look at the devastation of AIDS, this first full-length biography explains Wojnarowicz's powerful iconography in the context of a (literally) dying art scene.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Marianne Laino Sade, Library Journal</b></p><p>&#x201c;[Carr] tells [Wojnarowicz&#x2019;s] life story remarkably thoroughly and can&#x2019;t-put-it-down readably.

Subjects engaging Hampl's attention include her family's response to her writing, the ethics of writing about family and friends, St. Augustine's <em>Confessions</em>, reflections on reading Walt Whitman during the Vietnam War, and an early experience reviewing Sylvia Plath. The word that unites the impulse within all the pieces is "Remember!"&#x2015;a command that can be startling. For to remember is to make a pledge: to the indelible experience of personal perception, and to history itself.</p><p>In this collection of essays, Patricia Hampl attempts to explain the lure of the memoir. It is today one of the most popular literary genres, but not long ago, readers would have been hard-pressed even to find memoir sections in their favorite bookstores. Hampl, who herself is a memoirist of note (<i>A Romantic Education</i> and <i>Virgin Time</i>) opens the book with some of her own memories. She recalls a bus trip during the Vietnam War era to visit her "draft resister" boyfriend in jail. When the bus stops along the way in a small town, she notices a large, middle-age woman passionately kissing a very handsome, much younger man, or is it the other way around? The woman boards the bus while the young man runs along outside, blowing her kisses. She takes the seat next to Hampl and says with a sigh, "I could tell you stories."<p> This small event sets the stage for the rest of the book--it draws a narrative out of a mostly mundane moment and underscores the complicated nature of remembering events as they actually happened. She writes that because "everyone 'has' a memoir, we all have a stake in how such stories are told. For we do not, after all, simply <i>have</i> experience; we are entrusted with it." In the balance of the book, Hampl examines the autobiographical writings of St. Augustine, Anne Frank, Sylvia Plath, Edith Stein, and Czeslaw Milosz. In each instance, she attempts to uncover the writer's intentions and reveal the true secrets that lurk in the shadows of what's on the page. <i>I Could Tell You Stories</i> is an excellent investigation into what makes a story essentially worthy of being told and ultimately read--a good companion to whatever book is currently in your hands. <i>--Jordana Moskowitz</i></p>Patricia Hampl, Regents&#39; Professor at the University of Minnesota, lives in St. Paul.</p><h2>Mona Lisa Mystery</h2><p>Class 3 of Hampstead Primary School are off on a school trip to Paris!

An animated reading of the story gives the long narrative continuity and adds depth to the plot and characters. Forsyth keeps the action moving, enlivening each new part of the adventure with enthusiasm and the youthful reactions of the children. Seamless transitions between characters, plus her pleasant reading voice, greatly add to the listening experience. She performs the accents of the various French characters effectively, capturing the flavor of France and adding a touch of the exotic. Forsyth&#39;s voice catches just the right tones of excitement and suspense. P.A.J.

Milgram reported that fully 65 percent of the volunteers had repeatedly administered electric shocks of increasing strength to a man they believed to be in severe pain, even suffering a life-threatening heart condition, simply because an authority figure had told them to do so. Such behavior was linked to atrocities committed by ordinary people under the Nazi regime and immediately gripped the public imagination. The experiments remain a source of controversy and fascination more than fifty years later.<br> <br>In <i>Behind the Shock Machine</i>, psychologist and author Gina Perry unearths for the first time the full story of this controversial experiment and its startling repercussions. Interviewing the original participants&#x2014;many of whom remain haunted to this day about what they did&#x2014;and delving deep into Milgram&#x2019;s personal archive, she pieces together a more complex picture and much more troubling picture of these experiments than was originally presented by Milgram. Uncovering the details of the experiments leads her to question the validity of that 65 percent statistic and the claims that it revealed something essential about human nature. Fleshed out with dramatic transcripts of the tests themselves, the book puts a human face on the unwitting people who faced the moral test of the shock machine and offers a gripping, unforgettable tale of one man&#x2019;s ambition and an experiment that defined a generation.<br></p><p><b>Gina Perry</b> is a psychologist and writer.

The monumental clash on June 17, 1876, along Rosebud Creek in southeastern Montana pitted George Crook and his Shoshone and Crow allies against Sioux and Northern Cheyennes under Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. It set the stage for the battle that occurred eight days later when, just twenty-five miles away, George Armstrong Custer blundered into the very same village that had outmatched Crook. Historian Paul L. Hedren presents the definitive account of this critical battle, from its antecedents in the Sioux campaign to its historic consequences.<br><br><i>Rosebud, June 17, 1876</i> explores in unprecedented detail the events of the spring and early summer of 1876. Drawing on an extensive array of sources, including government reports, diaries, reminiscences, and a previously untapped trove of newspaper stories, the book traces the movements of both Indian forces and U.S. troops and their Indian allies as Brigadier General Crook commenced his second great campaign against the northern Indians for the year. Both Indian and army paths led to Rosebud Creek, where warriors surprised Crook and then parried with his soldiers for the better part of a day on an enormous field. Describing the battle from multiple viewpoints, Hedren narrates the action moment by moment, capturing the ebb and flow of the fighting. Throughout he weighs the decisions and events that contributed to Crook&#x2019;s tactical victory, and to his fateful decision thereafter not to pursue his adversary. The result is a uniquely comprehensive view of an engagement that made history and then changed its course.<br><br> Rosebud was at once a battle won and a battle lost. With informed attention to the subtleties and significance of both outcomes, as well as to the fears and motivations on all sides, Hedren has given new meaning to this consequential fight, and new insight into its place in the larger story of the Great Sioux War.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Paul L. Hedren </b>is a retired National Park Service superintendent residing in Omaha, Nebraska.

Along with translations from the <i>Aeneid</i> and the <i>Inferno</i>, this book offers several poems about Heaney's late father.</p></p><p><p><b>Seamus Heaney</b> received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995.</p>Suggestively framed by the poet's translations of excerpts from the Aeneid and the Inferno , this collection combines Heaney's richly textured style with visionary intent: the desire to invoke his dead father. Just as Aeneas begs for one meeting with his dear father, so does Heaney (Selected Poems 1966 - 1987) , and much of the book records those glimpses. In the title poem he recollects "That afternoon / I saw him face to face, he came to me / With his damp footprints out of the river, / And there was nothing between us there / That might not still be happily ever after."18 Heaney's spiritual excursions, reminiscent of Dante's, to the ghostly past and underworld will remind readers of the difficulties of voyages of the soul: "So draw no attention, steer and concentrate / On the space that flees between like a speeded-up / Meltdown of souls from the straw-flecked ice of hell."84 Although readers may sometimes get lost in the windings of the otherworld so vigorously evoked, most will judge the journey well worth the effort. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Psalms and the Life of Faith</h2><p>Walter Brueggemann&#39;s unique gift of joining historical-exegetical insights to penetrating observations about the traumas and joys of contemporary life both personal and social is here forcefully displayed.

Now she turns her focus to one of the most loved, brilliant, and iconoclastic women of our time: the actress, writer, daughter, and mother Carrie Fisher.</p><p>Weller traces Fisher&#x2019;s life from her Hollywood royalty roots to her untimely and shattering death after Christmas 2016. Her mother was the spunky and adorable Debbie Reynolds; her father, the heartthrob crooner Eddie Fisher. When Eddie ran off with Elizabeth Taylor, the scandal thrust little Carrie Frances into a bizarre spotlight, gifting her with an irony and an aplomb that would resonate throughout her life. </p><p>We follow Fisher&#x2019;s acting career, from her debut in <i>Shampoo</i>, the hit movie that defined mid-1970s Hollywood, to her seizing of the plum female role in <i>Star Wars</i>, which catapulted her to instant fame. We explore her long, complex relationship with Paul Simon and her relatively peaceful years with the talent agent Bryan Lourd. We witness her startling leap&#x2015;on the heels of a near-fatal overdose&#x2015;from actress to highly praised, bestselling author, the Dorothy Parker of her place and time.</p><p>Weller sympathetically reveals the conditions that Fisher lived with: serious bipolar disorder and an inherited drug addiction. Still, despite crises and overdoses, her life&#x2019;s work&#x2015;as an actor, a novelist and memoirist, a script doctor, a hostess, and a friend&#x2015;was prodigious and unique. As one of her best friends said, &#x201c;I almost wish the expression &#x2018;one of a kind&#x2019; didn&#x2019;t exist, because it applies to Carrie in a deeper way than it applies to others.&#x201d;</p><p>Sourced by friends, colleagues, and witnesses to all stages of Fisher&#x2019;s life, <i>Carrie Fisher: A Life on the Edge </i>is an empathic and even-handed portrayal of a woman who&#x2015;as Princess Leia, but mostly as herself&#x2015;was a feminist heroine, one who died at a time when we need her blazing, healing honesty more than ever.</p></p><p><b>Sheila Weller</b> is the author of the acclaimed family memoir <i>Dancing at Ciro&#x2019;s</i>;<i> </i>the<i> New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Girls Like Us: Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon&#x2015;and the Journey of a Generation</i>;<i> </i>and <i>The News Sorority: Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Christiane Amanpour&#x2015;and the Triumph of Women in TV News</i>.

Sheila Weller has created a brilliant kaleidoscopic portrait of a true original, smack in the center of our celebrity culture: a brassy, vulnerable lady with a searching intelligence rapier wit and a capacity for deep deep friendships. Sweeping in scope and intimate in tone, Weller charts Fisher's evolution with perception, balance, and a keen understanding of Fisher's tragic complexities. Importantly, Weller shows how Fisher kept challenging her dark experiences: she learned. She changed. She sometimes even found joy. <i>Carrie Fisher: A Life on the Edge</i> is a page-turner.

Fisher was a survivor of a movieland happily-ever-after that went gaudily off the rails (her family became an international scandal when her father, Eddie Fisher, left her mother, Debbie Reynolds, for Elizabeth Taylor), and of one of the most successful franchises in film history (<i>Star Wars</i>, of course), not to mention a hairdo that would&#x2019;ve sunk almost anybody else (think sci-fi George Eliot). But she was so much more than that: a curiosity, a sensation, a writer, a wreck, a wit, a flirt, an addict, a sage, a marvel, and, finally, a legend. She was, too, Hollywood&#x2019;s sharpest critic as well as its moral conscience and best friend. Weller&#x2019;s book captures the spirt of this complicated and contradictory figure.

It is the basic tool of creative unblocking and the basic tool of successful long-term weight loss as well. You will write three pages every morning, a practice that I call Morning Pages. They are to be strictly stream of consciousness, no "high art" here. You simply move your hand across the page and write whatever thought comes into your head. Even "non-thoughts" are fine. Don't expect or demand that you have a writing style. Any style at all will do. So fret, gripe, worry, scold&#x2014;or celebrate. There is no wrong way to do Morning Pages.</p><p>Your pages may sound grumpy and whiny&#x2014;"I'm awake and I want to sleep two more hours. I hate my job. I hate my boss. I hate the life I have invented for myself these days." Your pages might sound anxious and scattered. You might find yourself angry or sad. It's all right. It's all right. Your job is simply to get down on the page whatever it is you are.</p><p>What you are doing with your pages is something that in 12-step parlance is called "getting current." You are out to catch up on yourself, to pinpoint precisely what you are feeling and thinking. It's an interesting phrase, "getting current." Because that is exactly what we are doing. We are tapping into the energy flow in our lives, the current of who and what we are. When I get current, I feel more alive. I know who I am and what I want more of and what I want less of. Writing Morning Pages, I tap into a creative energy that flows like a subterranean river through my life.</p><p>One of the first fruits of Morning Pages is an upsurge of creativity in many forms. Apartments get painted. Curtains get hung. Long-overdue letters get written. Art forms that we have lost or forgotten come wafting back to us with increased urgency. "Don't put me off any longer," these zephyrs beg. When we listen to them, we start to flourish.</p><p>Morning Pages galvanize our days. They prioritize them as well. Writing Morning Pages, we begin to see that each day is made up of myriad "choice points" and that we have a great deal of freedom to choose exactly how we will live. Morning Pages make us aware of which activities are dead ends for us and which activities give us a sense of health and well-being. Like a tough-love friend, Morning Pages nudge us in the direction of needed change.</p><p>"I really need more exercise," we write one day. And a second day. And a third. On the fourth day we abruptly realize that we can take a twenty-minute walk on our lunch hour. We take that walk and the next day's pages record this small triumph.</p><p>Morning Pages put us in touch with our emotions. Often those emotions have been clogged, stuffed down beneath the weight of our busy days, days filled with work, relationships and, yes, food. Too often we have touched our feelings and recoiled as from a hot stove. We have been angry and felt our anger was taboo. We have been sad and turned to some mindless television to ignore it. We have even turned to food when we felt joy. Any intense emotion can trigger a Snack Attack.</p><p>Writing Morning Pages, our mindless lives are behind us. A day at a time, a page at a time, we become mindful, acutely attuned to our personal feelings. We might write "I am angry at my sister. Talking with her bores me silly. She just gets me on the phone and does a monologue. We haven't had a real conversation in years!" Realizing how we feel, we often make spontaneous changes. To our needy sister we say, "Wait a minute&#x2014;there's something I want to tell you"&#x2014;and then we tell her that we are not a wailing wall and that she, too, needs to learn to listen. To our surprise, she hears us. For the first time in years, conversation is a two-way street.</p><p>The pages examine all of our relationships, not the least of which is our relationship to food. "The junk food I am eating leaves me hung over," we might write. The very next day, faced with an opportunity to binge, we decline. "What's come over you?" our friends ask as we order a salad Ni�oise instead of our usual chicken potpie.</p><p>"My tastes have changed," we might joke, but more than just our tastes are changing. Jeannie began her day on Coca-Cola and moved on from there to Cheerios. "It was like a five-year-old was feeding me," she laughs. Her Morning Pages pointed out to her that she was living on sugar and starch and that a few fruits and vegetables might be in order. One day she found herself buying a container of fresh strawberries. "I've always loved fresh strawberries, but I never let myself have them. I just didn't feel deserving. A month of pages changed the habits of years. I simply couldn't bear to see how I was treating myself. Once I did see it, I knew it had to stop&#x2014;and it did."</p><p>The last time I heard from Jeannie, strawberries were a staple in her diet. She had exchanged her morning Coca-Colas for tea and had even started making herself salads for lunch. She had dropped three dress sizes and lost the telltale bloat on her fine-featured face. In the photo that she sent of herself and her new boyfriend, she looked fifteen years younger than her pre-pages self.</p><p>Morning Pages sweep the house of our consciousness. They poke into every odd corner of our thoughts. They are a catcher's mitt for many small ideas that lead to larger breakthroughs. "I'd like this room better red," we think one day of the foyer to our apartment. A week later the room is red and we do, in fact, like it better. But now we think our living room could use some sprucing up. It looks so dull by comparison...</p><p>A day at a time, a room at a time, we remake our environment. Now our apartment looks like someone with self-worth lives there. And someone with self-worth is struggling to be born.</p><p>"This relationship is suffocating me," we might write. Cornered by our pages, we face the difficult fact that our marriage is arid and that we feel parched and exhausted from trying single-handedly to make it work. "I deserve reciprocity," we scrawl early one morning. Later in the day we tell the same thing to our spouse. Standing up for ourselves, we begin to walk taller. We feel the self in self-worth.</p><p>It takes courage to undertake Morning Pages, but pages themselves give us courage. In the privacy of our journal, we admit the secrets we have been harboring. Once aired, those secrets lose their power to tyrannize us. Our pen is the scalpel with which we lance the psychic infections we have been carrying. "I hate this job," we write. "It's prestigious, but there's too much stress for too little reward."</p><p>Once we target a problem area, the pages are quick to suggest solutions. We are not trapped, pages remind us. We always have choices. Sometimes those choices are difficult. We may hate our job but love our salary. Pages encourage us to take accurate stock of our situation. Perhaps, for right now, the job is worth all its aggravation. We can choose to leave or we can choose to stay. Pages help us to sort our options.</p><p>Many of us find, writing pages, that we seem to be put into contact with a source of wisdom greater than ourselves. Answers swim into consciousness that seem far wiser than our personal thinking. It is for this reason that I have come to think of Morning Pages as an effective form of meditation&#x2014;especially for hyperactive Westerners. Most of us have a hard time with conventional meditation. It is very difficult for us to sit calmly and do nothing for twenty minutes. With pages, you sit calmly and do something. That something, the motion of the hand across the page, is actually a way of tracking what meditators speak of as "cloud thoughts." As our thoughts cross our consciousness, we record them on the page. Oddly, the very act of writing down our concerns helps us to put those concerns in their proper perspective. We miniaturize our irrational worries. We underscore our legitimate concerns. Morning Pages are a sorting process. At first on the page and then in our lives, we begin to get things straight.</p><p>With our pages as our ally, we begin to face down difficult issues. Some of us face squarely a long-suspected drinking problem. Others admit to using television as a potent narcotic. Many of us find that food is our favored blocking device.</p><p>"I was a late-night eater," says Anthony. "I didn't realize this until I began to record in my Morning Pages what felt like hangovers. I wasn't drinking. In fact, I prided myself on several years of sobriety, but there was no question that my mornings were hung over and that food was the substance I was abusing."</p><p>Self-knowledge is often the first step toward change, and when Anthony admitted his abusive eating, he took a step toward discontinuing it. "It didn't happen overnight," he says. "But I began to record, hung over again,' and then, one night, I aborted a late-night snack halfway through, saying to myself, 'You don't want to be hung over in the morning, do you?' "</p><p>When Anthony abandoned his late-night binges, he found that he had immediate access to greater creative energy. "I found I was full of late-night ideas and that a fear of this energy had been at the root of my overeating." No longer overeating to thwart his creativity, Anthony saw that he had many healthy choices in front of him. For one thing, he had the time and energy to write his long-delayed memoirs.</p><p>"My extra pounds were a barricade I placed between me and my freedom," he realized. "When I gave up late-night grazing, the pounds slowly began to slip away and I found myself making many healthy changes."</p><p>Believing himself trapped in a dead-end job, Marcus saw that he was in fact unwilling to do the footwork to find new employment. He was in jail, all right, but he held the key&#x2014;he just needed the will to use it.</p><p>"One morning, I wrote I hate my job' for the last time," he recalls. "That day I picked up the phone and called a head hunter. I soon learned that I was eminently employable."</p><p>Morning Pages point us in the direction of our growth. They make us intimate with ourselves and that, in turn, allows us to be more authentically intimate with others. Leslie found herself writing that she was unhappy in her relationship. As she explored this in subsequent pages, she learned that she was hungry for deeper communication than what she enjoyed with her lover. "Try telling him that," her pages suggested one morning. The advice brought Leslie face-to-face with the fact that she had almost sabotaged her relationship rather than risk honesty within it.</p><p>As we risk honesty in our pages, it becomes easier to be honest elsewhere. Leslie admitted in her Morning Pages that she was feeling stifled by her lover's codependency. "I resented his possessiveness, but I also went along with it because I was, frankly, a little flattered by it," she says. In her pages she rehearsed what she wanted to say: "I just need a little more breathing room," she told him. "I don't want to do everything together." When she risked more disclosure, he risked more disclosure in turn. To her surprise, he admitted to similar feelings. They were actually both feeling smothered. This conversation gave them the courage to open the cage door. They soon found that their increased independence gave their time together greater intensity and meaning.</p><p>Greater intensity and meaning are common experiences for those who choose to work with Morning Pages. The experience is not unlike falling in love&#x2014;but the object of our affections is now the Self. We become interesting to ourselves. Our thoughts, feelings, and perceptions count for something. A page at a time, a day at a time, we are becoming intimate with ourselves, and that intimacy is often both threatening and thrilling.</p><p>Janice undertook Morning Pages because of a mysterious malaise that she did not understand. She was happily married to Bill, a charismatic, high-powered salesman. He spoiled her with material blessings. Her every wish was his command. Every year Bill's earning power seemed to increase. They traded in home after home, always moving to bigger and better abodes. Pampered and pudgy, Janice dutifully decorated each new nest&#x2014;but she resented it.</p><p>Janice's pages suggested to her that their pursuit of the great American Dream was actually a frenzied and empty pursuit. "I didn't need more. I actually needed less. I needed to be able to cherish what I had, not constantly trade it in for something else." With the help of pages, Janice saw that her own dreams had become submerged beneath the dreams and goals of her husband. She wanted to write&#x2014;and more than the steady stream of bread and-butter notes that their lifestyle demanded. Bill traveled in his work. Janice was often lonely, but she decided to use her empty time to take a writing course. Her creativity took off like a rocket. Soon she was asked to script a radio show&#x2014;then to host it.</p><p>"I became a writing fiend," Janice laughs. "They were paying me to write, but I would have paid them!" She also became thinner, no longer an overstuffed hen sitting on her nest egg.</p><p>Morning Pages teach us what we like&#x2014;and what we don't like. A line at a time, they move us closer to our authentic selves. In Morning Pages we stop hiding. We come out into the open&#x2014; at least on the page. "I'd really like to try... "we write&#x2014;and then we try it. Dreams long deferred move, step by step, into reality. We discover that as we move our hand across the page, a Higher Hand moves across the surface of our lives. For many of us, pages are a spiritual experience as we make contact with a Power Greater Than Ourselves.</p><p>Alice lost both of her parents to early deaths. An adult, she often still felt like an orphaned child. She was surprised to find comfort in writing Morning Pages. Time and again she would write out guidance that seemed to her far wiser than any of her own devising. "At first it was as if I became my own wise parent. Then I began to wonder if perhaps my own parents weren't speaking to me through the pages. They began to feel much closer to me and I began to feel far less alone. The pages became for me a source of companionship and strength. I began to think of them as my personal spiritual practice. They kept me on track and gave me an even keel."</p><p>For many of us, an even keel is elusive. We long for stability but we do not know how to find it. Pages may be the first effective form of mentoring that we encounter. We make contact with what might be called an Inner Mentor. Under its tutelage, we are able both to remain stable and to take risks.</p><p>Alan began doing Morning Pages when he took an Artist's Way class. For twelve weeks he wrote every morning, watching with some awe as his ordinary life became transformed. For many years he had dreamed of being a playwright. At the urging of pages he now tried a few short monologues&#x2014;and read them aloud to great success at an open mic. With such encouragement, you might think he would be firm in keeping to his new regimen&#x2014; instead, when his class ended, Alan abandoned it.</p><p>As Alan abandoned his pages, he abandoned himself. No longer listening for guidance, he accepted a new, high-powered job in a field that he didn't really like. In fact, the only thing to like about his new job was the salary.

For a thousand years and more before the Europeans came, a great culture flourished in these islands. The masterworks of classical Haida sculpture, now enshrined in many of the world's great museums, range from exquisite tiny amulets to magnificent huge housepoles. Classical Haida literature is every bit as various and fine. It extends from tiny jewels crafted by master songmakers to elaborate mythic cycles lasting many hours.<br><br>The linguist and ethnographer John Swanton took dictation from the last great Haida-speaking storytellers, poets and historians from the fall of 1900 through the summer of 1901. His Haida hosts and colleagues had been raised in a wholly oral world where the mythic and the personal interpenetrate completely. They joined forces with their visitor, consciously creating a great treasury of Haida oral literature in written form. Poet and linguist Robert Bringhurst has worked for many years with these century-old manuscripts, which have waited until now for the broad recognition they deserve.<br><br>Bringhurst brings these works to life in the English language and sets them in a context just as rich as the stories themselves--one that reaches out to dozens of Native American oral literatures, and to mythtelling traditions around the globe.<br><br>The world of classical Haida literature is a world as deep as the ocean, as close as the heart and as elusive as the Raven, whose unrepentant laugh persists within it all. This is a tradition brimming with profundity, hilariy and love. It belongs where Bringhurst sees it: among the great traditions of the world.<br><br>Bringhurst, an acclaimed typographer and book designer, will be redesigning this edition in a beautiful new package.</p><p>Robert Bringhurst is one of Canada's most respected poets, designers and most probing cultural historians.

Moving beyond typical conservative and liberal approaches, which seek to either defend or whitewash over violence in the Bible, <i>Disarming Scripture</i> takes a surprising yet compelling approach: <i>Learning to read the Bible like Jesus did.</i> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the way the book deals with some very big issues, ranging from passages commanding genocide and infanticide in the Old Testament to passages in the New Testament that have been used to justify slavery, child abuse, and state violence. The take-away is an approach to Scripture that not only sees questioning as an acceptable part of a healthy faith, but as an absolutely essential part of it.</p><p>Derek Flood is the author of Healing the Gospel: A Radical Vision for Grace, Justice, and the Cross (Cascade, 2012), and is a featured blogger for the Huffington Post, Sojourners, and Red Letter Christians. He holds a masters degree in systematic theology from the Graduate Theological Union."A perceptive and honest book about the vexed question of violence in the Bible. Taking with great seriousness the dynamism of the biblical tradition and the interpretive process, the distinctive contribution of Disarming Scripture is an exploration of the way in which the biblical text itself interprets texts of violence. This is a fine contribution to our common work."<br> <br> --<strong>Walter Brueggemann</strong>, Emeritus professor, Columbia Theological Seminary, and author of <em>The Prophetic Imagination</em><br><br>"Jesus is the savior of everything--including the Bible! That's what I kept thinking while reading this brilliant book. There have been a number of excellent books in recent years on how Christians should read the Bible, but Disarming Scripture is the very best. Derek has done us an immeasurable service in showing us how to read the Bible like Jesus did."<br> <br> --<b>Brian Zahnd</b>, Pastor of Word of Life Church, and author of <i>A Farewell to Mars</i><br><br>"A morally responsible, dynamic reading of scripture, where Jesus and Paul move us along a trajectory toward a non-violent God and a non-violent people of God. Flood leaves no stone unturned in presenting his case with remarkable subtlety in an easy-reading style, handling biblical violence with bracing honesty and spiritual and intellectual substance." <br> <br> --<b>Peter Enns</b>, Professor of Biblical Studies, Eastern University and author of <i>The Bible Tells Me So</i><br><br>"<i>Disarming Scripture</i> shows us how we can confront difficult passages in the Bible which seem to condone or even command violence.

McLaren</strong>, Speaker, pastor, activist, and author of <em>We Make the Road By Walking</em><br><br>"Disarming Scripture may well be the most thought-provoking and liberating book about the Bible that you will ever read. How do we reconcile a God of grace and compassion with the one who sanctions violence and killing?

Although he always considered himself a highly positive person, Howard had a realization that under pressure and under the stresses and gravity of life, he was actually self-critical and negative thinking. The Nurtured Heart Approach evolved into a personal practice that shifted him from random forms of negativity to an expansive focus on seeing and growing greatness, both within himself and through all his relationships. He found himself drawn powerfully into self-talk that went beyond any standard version of positivity. He found this to be transformative and life changing. From this, he developed a greatness practice that could be taught to others. This book is a revealing and transparent exploration of this practice.</p><p>Howard Glasser is the Chairman of the Board of the Children&#39;s Success Foundation and creator of The Nurtured Heart Approach�. He is dedicated to awakening the greatness in all children, with a particular focus on intense and challenging children. The approach s core methodologies, born out of his extensive clinical work, effectively inspire difficult children to successfully channel their intensity. Worldwide, hundreds of thousands of parents, educators, and treatment and child-advocacy agencies have used this approach with consistently transformative results. Howard is the author of Transforming the Difficult Child, currently the top-selling book on ADHD; Notching Up the Nurtured Heart Approach: The New Inner Wealth Initiative, a leading book on school interventions; and All Children Flourishing, on using the NHA with all children, difficult or not. Four of Howard s prior eight books are in the top one percent of all books on Amazon, confirming the need and relevance of his message and methodology. All parents and educators, even those with well-behaved children, can benefit from learning how to inspire thriving relationships through the Nurtured Heart Approach�. Howard has been called one of the most influential living persons working to reduce children s reliance on psychiatric medications. His work also supports children in resisting addictive substances. He has been a featured guest on CNN, a consultant for 48 Hours, and was recently featured in Esquire. He currently instructs educators, parents and therapists through live presentations and Internet-based courses. Although he has done extensive doctoral work in Clinical Psychology and Educational Leadership, he credits his own years as an intense child as the strongest contributors to his understanding of the needs of children with immense life force.Igniting Greatness is not a traditional self-help guide. Instead of giving step-by-step instructions for improving ourselves, Howard Glasser provides us with the understanding that we each already possess the qualities of greatness needed to be our best selves. through teaching of the Nurtured Heart Approach, and through sharing his stories and personal experiences, we are given the tools for discovering and cultivating our own unique greatness.

For many of us, a question that needs to be answered is &#x201c;Am I a person of faith?&#x201d; The answer is almost always affirmative. In this book, my primary goal is to explore the broader meaning of faith, its far-reaching effect on our lives, and its relationship to past, present, and future events in America and around the world. I also emphasize the religious aspects of faith since this is how the word is most often used, and I have included a description of the ways my own faith has guided and sustained me, as well as how it has challenged and driven me to seek a closer and better relationship with people and with God. Faith, in both its religious and broader dimensions, influences our individual and communal lives, our lives in religion, and our lives in government and in secular affairs.<br> <br>The most important element of faith ever imposed on me, and on another person simultaneously, involved the threat of the total elimination of human life on earth by a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. My ultimate responsibility as President of the United States was to defend my country against a military attack, and I learned soon after my election that we and the Soviets had enough atomic weapons in our arsenals to destroy each other and that the resulting radiation and other collateral damage would kill most of the rest of the world&#x2019;s population. This was a constant haunting realization that dominated my conscious hours during my term in office&#x2014;and I shared the responsibility with Leonid Brezhnev, President of the Soviet Union. Our common goal, of course, was to avoid a nuclear war. Brezhnev and I had to have faith in ourselves, and in each other. Every decision I made was affected by this threat, and it still exists, as the same responsibility is passed on from one president to the next.<br> <br>We face many issues within which religion, politics, and private matters tend to mix, sometimes explosively, creating sharp divisions among us, in our private and public lives and between and within religious denominations. It is increasingly difficult to keep issues of religion and government separate, as even the purely religious issues are routinely addressed by politicians&#x2014;and vice versa. I have confronted the separation of government and religion from both directions. I think often of the strong reaction of our visiting revival preacher in my mother&#x2019;s home when I decided to run for the state senate back in 1962. He asked me, &#x201c;How can you, as a Christian, a deacon, and a Sunday School teacher, become involved in the dirty business of politics?&#x201d; Without thinking, I gave him a smart-aleck response: &#x201c;I will have 75,000 people in my senate district. How would you like to have a congregation that big?&#x201d;<br> <br>I believe now, more than then, that Christians are called to plunge into the life of the world, and to inject the moral and ethical values of our faith into the processes of governing. At the same time, there must be an absolute prohibition against granting any control by government over our religious freedoms. More recently, since our years in the White House, I have tended to move away from politics and toward religion, but the two are still related. There is no doubt that my having been a national political leader is what attracts most visitors to my Bible classes, and it is clear to me that many of these worshippers are eager to help shape our nation&#x2019;s political agenda.<br> <br>In a speech to my fellow Baptists in 1978, I tried to explain the duality of my personal responsibilities as a president and a Christian:<br> <br>Thomas Jefferson, in the original days of our country, said he was fearful that the church might influence the state to take away human liberty. Roger Williams, who created the first Baptist church in America, was afraid that the church might be corrupted by the state. These concerns led to our Constitution&#x2019;s First Amendment, which prohibits the establishment of any official state religion and, in the same sentence, prohibits the passing of any laws that might interfere with religious freedom.<br> <br>Separation is specified in the law, but for a religious person, there is nothing wrong with bringing these two together, because you can&#x2019;t divorce religious beliefs from public service. At the same time, of course, in public office you cannot impose your own religious beliefs on others.<br> <br>In my office at the White House I have to deal with many domestic and international problems: peace, freedom, nuclear explosives, the sale of weapons, terrorism, rapidly expanding populations without adequate food. But this is more than a list of political problems. These are also moral problems for you and me, because they violate the very precepts of God in which we believe.<br> <br>I want our country to be strong enough in all elements, military and otherwise, so we never have to prove we are strong.<br> <br>Reinhold Niebuhr, in his book Moral Man and Immoral Society, pointed out the difference between a society and a people. The expectations from a person are a much higher standard. A person should have as our goal complete agape (self-sacrificial love). The most we can expect from a society is to institute simple justice.<br> <br>So, we as people have to do better, particularly if we are blessed with the opportunity to demonstrate our worth. Leaders also must be careful not to be too timid. . . .<br> <br>A country will have authority and influence because of moral factors, not its military strength; because it can be humble and not blatant and arrogant; because our people and our country want to serve others and not dominate others. And a nation without morality will soon lose its influence around the world.<br> <br>What are the goals of a person or a denomination or a country? They are all remarkably the same: a desire for peace; a need for humility, for examining one&#x2019;s faults and turning away from them; a commitment to human rights in the broadest sense of the words, based on a moral society concerned with the alleviation of suffering because of deprivation or hatred or hunger or physical affliction; and a willingness, even an eagerness, to share one&#x2019;s ideals, one&#x2019;s faith with others, to translate love in a person to justice.<br> <br>I was brought up in a family that was stable, cohesive, and remarkably isolated from the outside world, except for the small community of Plains, Georgia. Home was our unchangeable haven, in times of pain or pleasure. There was no doubt that my father made the final decisions, but we all knew that Mama&#x2019;s influence and opinions were always major factors in the management of our family. There were certain aspects of life, particularly in the running of the household and the raising of my sisters, that were almost exclusively my mother&#x2019;s purview. Together, our parents were dominant, and we children respected and obeyed them. In fact, I never deliberately disobeyed either of them. It was my mother, then my father, in whom I had absolute faith.<br> <br>Nowadays, most Americans move around frequently and are exposed to many influences, and our environments and customs are multifaceted. But for me as a child, there were just a few sources of knowledge about myself or any other people. Our contacts with the world beyond our community were limited. We didn&#x2019;t have running water or electricity in our house, so time on the battery radio was restricted, even on the rare evenings when we stayed up after dark. On special nights, keeping our eyes fixed on the radio, we listened as a family to The Lone Ranger, Little Orphan Annie, Fibber McGee and Molly, and Amos &#x2019;n&#x2019; Andy. My parents would sometimes let me stay up until 8:00 P.M. to hear Glenn Miller&#x2019;s band playing the current musical hits for fifteen minutes. That was all the outside world I knew. In addition to my family and our close neighbors, all African-American, I encountered other people just through school and the church in Plains. Our prom parties, which parents would support for entertainment and primarily to let boys and girls get acquainted in preparation for future marriages, were orchestrated by the church.<br> <br>Sunday mornings were for Sunday School and preaching at Plains Baptist Church, where Daddy was a teacher and a deacon. I remember vividly that after church we always had the best meal of the week, usually fried chicken, mashed potatoes, hot biscuits, and vegetables from our big garden, followed by pies made from sweet potatoes or fruits of the season. Afterward, our activities were severely limited. There were no stores open, movies in the county seat were out of the question, and shooting a gun or playing cards was prohibited. Fishing in the nearby creek or pond was a close call, but eventually it came to be permitted if done discreetly. It would not have been appropriate, however, to walk down a public road with a fishing pole. My mother and father played cards, mostly bridge, but certainly not on Sunday. At the age of twelve, when I was deemed old enough to drive a car by myself, my sisters and I went back to the church on Sunday evenings for meetings of the Baptist Young People&#x2019;s Union (BYPU). This was very important, because it was the BYPU that sponsored most of the teenage social events. I need not go on, since the picture is fairly clear. It was a simple, family-centered, deeply religious, working existence, with interracial labor and play on the farm with my black neighbors. All the farmwork was done by humans or mules, and we grew corn as the common fuel for both. I imagine that, except for the radio, automobile, and a hand-cranked telephone, our lives were quite similar to those of our great-grandparents.<br> <br>During those early years, I witnessed the racial discrimination that still survived almost a hundred years after the end of the Civil War. Mandatory segregation of black and white citizens was supported and enforced, at least in the Southeastern United States, by state and federal laws, and was not questioned by anyone of influence that I knew. The only person who paid no attention to these racial customs was my mother, and she treated everyone the same because, I presumed, she was a registered nurse and a member of the medical profession. When I was a child, all my friends and playmates were African-American, and the one who was preeminent at any time was whoever had caught the biggest fish, killed the most rabbits, or could run faster, jump higher, or pick the most cotton in a day. When I rode to our county seat with one of my playmates, we always sat in different railroad cars and at separate levels in the movie theater, attended different schools and churches, and I knew that white students rode in buses and black students walked to and from school. I do not remember knowing that only white adults were permitted to vote and to serve on juries.<br> <br>My first awareness of how segregation affected me and my friends was when my playmates and I were about twelve years old, when we were leaving the field and approaching the barn through what we called the &#x201c;pasture gate.&#x201d; The two black boys stood back to let me pass, and I presumed there was a trip wire there or some other reason for them to want me to go through first. Only much later did I realize that their parents had probably told them it was time for them to defer to me in some way. In a poem I wrote as an adult, I said,<br> <br>We only saw it vaguely then,<br> <br>but we were transformed at that place.<br> <br>A silent line was drawn between<br> <br>friend and friend, race and race.<br> <br>The next event that affected me directly was when I was a submarine officer and President Harry Truman ordained as commander in chief that all our military forces and the U.S. Civil Service end racial segregation. There was no trouble in implementing this command, and all of us on the ship saw the advantages gained by both black and white members of the crew. When our family returned home from the navy in 1953, this commitment to racial equality had become a part of our lives.<br> <br>My father taught me that there should be a strict divide between religion and politics, and he also resented very deeply any intrusion of state or federal laws into our private affairs. I remember that Daddy opposed changing our clocks from &#x201c;God&#x2019;s sun time&#x201d; to &#x201c;daylight saving time,&#x201d; and although a staunch Democrat in other elections, he never voted for Franklin D. Roosevelt after 1932, because the New Deal agricultural program provided, to stabilize farm prices, that half-grown pigs (shoats) should be slaughtered and that part of our growing crops of cotton and peanuts had to be plowed up. For many years afterward, Daddy recalled how difficult it was to force a trained mule to walk on top of a planted row to plow it up instead of in the middle to cultivate. I guess that today he would be known as a libertarian.<br> <br>When I look back on my life, I can see how startling the changes have been. Eric Hoffer (1902&#x2013;1983), the self-educated longshoreman and philosopher, described the years during my childhood as a time of hope, and the time of my adulthood as a time of desire. I knew the Great Depression years to be a time of hope, when the economic situation in America was so bad that everyone believed it could only improve; when things became plentiful, we tended to want not only what we already had but also what everyone else had.<br> <br>Both at my presidential inauguration and when receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, I quoted my favorite teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, who summarized her advice on how to accommodate the uncertainties in our future: &#x201c;We must welcome changing times, but cling to principles that never change.&#x201d; I would say that &#x201c;cling to&#x201d; meant &#x201c;have faith in.&#x201d; I have thought often about Miss Julia&#x2019;s advice over the years, and especially during some of the most trying times of my life, when I had to decide which enduring principles should be applied to a particular event or situation, and sometimes I use it in my church and college classes and in counseling people who are distressed about current crises that we have to face.<br> <br>Today, of course, family life even in the small Plains community is quite different. Some activities that were once strictly concealed in our &#x201c;proper&#x201d; society are probably no more prevalent but are now out in the open. Divorce has become acceptable, even for active church members. Without trying to analyze it too deeply, I see that one of the most significant changes is the relationship between young people and their parents. My siblings and I had an intimate and subservient relationship with our parents until we left home, but now the ties are substantially broken during the early teen years, no matter how much parents want to retain a strong influence over their growing children. The outside world is a much more powerful factor in life, with the availability of rapid transportation, television, social media, and particularly a broader circle of friends (and possibly rivals or adversaries), whose influence often exceeds that of immediate families. But perhaps just as many in today&#x2019;s world would still like to have certain faith in a core of principles that do not change. Wher...</p><h2>Walking the Nile</h2><p>The Nile, one of the world&#x2019;s great rivers, has long been an object of fascination and obsession. From Alexander the Great and Nero, to Victorian adventurers David Livingstone, John Hanning Speke, and Henry Morton Stanley, the river has enticed many into wild adventures. English writer, photographer, and explorer Levison Wood continues that tradition, and <i>Walking the Nile</i> is the captivating account of his remarkable and unparalleled Nile journey.<br><br>Starting in November 2013 in a forest in Rwanda, where a modest spring spouts a trickle of clear, cold water, Wood set forth on foot, aiming to become the first person to walk the entire length of the fabled river. He followed the Nile for nine months, over 4,000 miles, through six nations Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, the Republic of Sudan, and Egypt to the Mediterranean coast.<br><br>Like his predecessors, Wood camped in the wild, foraged for food, and trudged through rainforest, swamp, savannah, and desert, enduring life-threatening conditions at every turn. He traversed sandstorms, flash floods, minefields, and more, becoming a local celebrity in Uganda, where a popular rap song was written about him, and a potential enemy of the state in South Sudan, where he found himself caught in a civil war and detained by the secret police. As well as recounting his triumphs, like escaping a charging hippo and staving off wild crocodiles, Wood&#x2019;s gripping account recalls the loss of Matthew Power, a journalist who died suddenly from heat exhaustion during their trek. As Wood walks on, often joined by local guides who help him to navigate foreign languages and customs, <i>Walking the Nile</i> maps out African history and contemporary life.<br><br>An inimitable tale of survival, resilience, and sheer willpower, <i>Walking the Nile</i> is an inspiring chronicle of an epic journey down this lifeline of civilization.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2016:</strong> In November 2013, Levison Wood set out on an improbable and dangerous undertaking: walking the 4,000 miles of the Nile River from the trickle of its Rwandan headwaters to its Egyptian delta, a trek that would take him through six countries, strife and civil wars, swamps and sandstorms, thousands of years of history, and personal tragedy. <em>Walking the Nile</em> is Wood's account of the expedition, a briskly paced blend of gripping adventure tale and a portrait of modern Africa, full of objective hazards including crocodiles, minefields, and secret police. But why? Even Wood has trouble answering that question, but "ultimately, it came down to one thing. The Nile was there, and I wanted to walk it." George Mallory would be proud. <em>--Jon Foro</em><b>Levison Wood</b> is a writer, photographer, and explorer.

In this exemplary biography, Stefan Kanfer explores the roots of Lucy&#x2019;s genius and places it in the context of her conflicted and sometimes bitter personal life. <br><br><b>Ball of Fire</b> gives us Lucy in all her contradictions. Here is the beauty who became a master of knock-down slapstick; the control freak whose comic alter ego thrived on chaos, the worshipful TV housewife whose real marriage ended in public disaster. Here, too, is an intimate view of the dawn of television and of the America that embraced it. Charming, informative, touching. and laugh-out-loud funny, this is the book Lucy&#x2019;s fans have been waiting for.</p><p>Those expecting a vicious Hollywood tell-all from Stefan Kanfer&#x2019;s <i>Ball of Fire: The Tumultuous Life and Comic Art of Lucille Ball</i> will be disappointed. Kanfer, whose past work includes a biography of Groucho Marx and a history of the animation industry, comes to his famous red-headed subject with admiration, and readers will be drawn by his exuberance for early film and television history. <p> Kanfer opens with a brief recounting of Ball's tragic childhood (her father died of typhoid when she was 3 years old) and her early career as an unintentionally starving model in New York City. The significant portion of the book begins, however, when Ball gets her first offer for a stint of film work in California and finds herself launched on a moderately successful film career. Here Kanfer provides details of the inner workings of United Artists, Columbia, and RKO as Ball does battle with Ginger Rogers, Kathryn Hepburn, and a host of other young actresses struggling for screen time. But, as Kanfer notes, it was in television that Ball made her great mark, starring with her husband Desi Arnaz. <i>I Love Lucy</i> debuted in 1951, and readers will delight in Kanfer&#x2019;s behind-the-scenes details of the show&#x2019;s production. The first situation comedy to be filmed before a live audience, <i>Lucy</i> offered countless challenge--technical, professional, and personal&#x2014;for the volatile couple. </p><p> Kanfer argues that Ball is one of the few truly enduring television personalities to emerge from the early years of television. His book, entertaining as it is educational, does much to secure her legacy. <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley</i></p>&#x201c;Among Stefan Kanfer&#x2019;s gifts as a biographer are scrupulous research, fine judgement, and a critical knowledge of the wider world.

As seen through the eyes of a twelve-year-old girl named Una, it takes place in northern England in 1977, as the Yorkshire Ripper, a serial killer of prostitutes, is on the loose and creating panic among the townspeople. As the police struggle in their clumsy attempts to find the killer, and the headlines in the local paper become more urgent, a once self-confident Una teaches herself to "lower her gaze" in order to deflect attention from boys.</p><p>After she is "slut-shamed" at school for having birth control pills, Una herself is the subject of violent acts for which she comes to blame herself. But as the police finally catch up and identify the killer, Una grapples with the patterns of behavior that led her to believe she was to blame.</p><p><i>Becoming Unbecoming </i>combines various styles, press clippings, photo-based illustrations, and splashes of color to convey Una's sense of confusion and rage, as well as sobering statistics on sexual violence against women.

From the Big Bang to that far-off future time, two billion years from now, when our planet will be a waterless rock; from the lush crowds of life at seafloor hot springs to the invisible, jewel-like plants that float at the sea surface; from the restless shifting of the tectonic plates to the majestic sweep of the ocean currents, Kunzig's clear and lyrical prose transports us to the ends of the Earth.<br><br> Originally published in hardcover as <em>The Restless Sea</em>.

It is an honest confession of a diagnosis of cancer and the joys and disappointments of motherhood and marriage, ripe with regret over what is and, yet, still hopeful for what could be.</p><p>With enough humor to ease the rawness of the story, <em>Undone</em> takes the reader on a roller coaster two-year journey through the unexpectedness of life. A look back makes Michele long for a do-over, the chance to make fewer mistakes and leave less of a mess to clean up. A look forward makes Michele wonder if all her attempts to control life have robbed her of the vibrancy of it. And, in the middle of this internal chaos, she finds her once-pristine house filled with the sights and sounds of three small, uncontainable children who just want to be loved.</p><p>In the end, <em>Undone</em> turns complication into a beautiful canvas, angst into joy, and the unknown into an adventure, revealing that sometimes life&#x2019;s most colorful and courageous stories are written right in the middle of the mess.</p></p><p>If your life is everything you dreamed it to be, this book isn't for you. Just move along; you won't hurt my feelings.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, if you've ever known what it's like to have a dream unravel, a hope or desire remain unfulfilled, regardless of how long and hard you've wished and prayed otherwise, then Undone isn't just my story.<br> &nbsp;<br> It's your story.<br> &nbsp;<br> Life seldom turns out like we imagine. Oh, we try to make it everything we've dreamed it to be. We work oh-so-hard on our marriages. We exercise, eat right and care for our health. We parent with feverish desperation. We read books, go to conferences, take notes and then try a bit harder. But regardless of our efforts, sometimes the unthinkable happens.<br> &nbsp;<br> A marriage disintegrates. A child run aways from home. A doctor calls with bad news. A church splits right down the middle. In the span of seconds, ordinary life turns upside down. And everything you thought you knew and loved about your life is gone, evaporated in front of your eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> What you're left with resembles nothing of the life you dreamed. It's messy, uncomfortable, and just plain hard. Painful, even. And no matter what you do, no matter how many times you pick yourself back up again and try to fix it, the life you dream about remains out of reach.<br> &nbsp;<br> So if you're at the end of your hope, if you wake up and wonder how in the world you can go on with this unexpected life you've been given, if you're tired of fear and desperate for a drowning of peace, pull up a chair, my friend. You're not alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> And, believe it or not, undone is beautiful.A storyteller at heart, Michele Cushatt inspires audiences with the warmth of her transparency and presence.

There are many more chakras than the conventional seven that have traditionally been in use. As the frequency of the human organism is raised, additional chakras are opening up to assimilate higher dimensional energy. This frequency uplift, and overall well-being, can be facilitated by stimulating the rise of kundalini energy, which in turn can be activated with appropriate crystals. However, spontaneous kundalini awakening can be overwhelming. Fortunately crystals have the answer. This new directory in the A-Z series assists you to identify exactly the right crystal to release any blockages and return the chakras to a state of equilibrium. This will enable the higher chakras to open and controlled kundalini rise to occur.</p><p>An internationally known author, astrologer, psychic, healer and workshop leader, Judy Hall has been a karmic counsellor for over forty five years and is the author of the million selling Crystal Bibles.

She lives with her husband and children in a quaint suburb of Stockholm.The Preacher 1<p></p> <br>The day was off to a promising start. He woke up early, before the rest of the family, put on his clothes as quietly as possible and managed to sneak out unnoticed. He took along his knight&#x2019;s helmet and wooden sword, which he swung happily as he ran the hundred yards from the house down to the mouth of the King&#x2019;s Cleft. He stopped for a moment and peered in awe into the sheer crevice through the rocky outcrop. The sides of the rock were six or seven feet apart, and it towered up over thirty feet into the sky, into which the summer sun had just begun to climb. Three huge boulders were solidly wedged in the middle of the cleft, and it was an imposing sight. The place held a magical attraction for a six-year-old. The fact that the King&#x2019;s Cleft was forbidden ground made it all the more tempting.<br> <br>The name had originated from King Oscar II&#x2019;s visit to Fj�llbacka in the late nineteenth century, but that was something he neither knew nor cared about as he slowly crept into the shadows, with his sword ready to attack. His father had told him that the scenes from Hell&#x2019;s Gap in the film Ronja R�vardotter had been filmed inside the King&#x2019;s Cleft. When he had watched the film himself, he felt a little tickle in his stomach as he saw the robber chieftain Mattis ride through. Sometimes he played highwaymen here, but today he was a knight. A knight of the Round Table, like in the big, fancy colored book that his grandmother had given him for his birthday.<br> <br>He crept over the boulders that covered the ground and made ready to attack the great fire-breathing dragon with his courage and his sword. The summer sun did not reach down into the cleft, which made it a cold, dark place. Perfect for dragons. Soon he would make the blood spurt from its throat, and after prolonged death throes it would fall dead at his feet.<br> <br>Out of the corner of his eye he saw something that caught his attention. He glimpsed a piece of red cloth behind a boulder, and curiosity got the better of him. The dragon could wait; maybe there was treasure hidden there. He jumped up on the rock and looked down the other side. For a moment he almost fell over backward, but after wobbling and flailing his arms around he regained his balance. Later, he would not admit that he was scared, but just then, at that instant, he had never been more terrified in all six years of his life. A lady was lying in wait for him. She was on her back, staring straight up at him with her eyes wide. His first instinct was to flee before she caught him playing here when he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be. Maybe she would force him to tell her where he lived and then drag him home to Mamma and Pappa. They would be so furious, and they were sure to ask, how many times have we told you that you mustn&#x2019;t go to the King&#x2019;s Cleft without a grown-up?<br> <br>But the odd thing was that the lady didn&#x2019;t move. She didn&#x2019;t have any clothes on either, and for an instant he was embarrassed that he was standing there looking at a naked lady. The red he had seen was not a piece of cloth but something wet right next to her, and he couldn&#x2019;t see her clothes anywhere. Funny, lying there naked. Especially when it was so cold.<br> <br>Then something impossible occurred to him. What if the lady was dead? He couldn&#x2019;t work out any other explanation for why she was lying so still. The realization made him jump down from the rock, and he slowly backed toward the mouth of the cleft. After putting a few yards between himself and the dead lady, he turned around and ran home as fast as he could. He no longer cared if he was scolded or not.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Sweat made the sheet stick to her body. Erica tossed and turned in bed, but it was impossible to find a comfortable position. The bright summer night didn&#x2019;t make it any easier to sleep, and for the thousandth time she made a mental note to buy some blackout curtains to hang up, or rather persuade Patrik to do it.<br> <br>It drove her crazy that he could sleep so contentedly next to her. How dare he lie there snoring when she lay awake night after night? She gave him a little poke in the hope that he&#x2019;d wake up. He didn&#x2019;t budge. She poked a little harder. He grunted, pulled the covers up and turned his back to her.<br> <br>With a sigh, she lay on her back with her arms crossed over her breasts and stared at the ceiling. Her belly arched into the air like a big globe, and she tried to imagine her baby swimming inside of her in the dark. Maybe with his thumb in his mouth. Although it was all still too unreal for her to be able to picture it. She was in her eighth month but still couldn&#x2019;t grasp the fact that she had another life inside her. Well, pretty soon it was going to be very real. Erica was torn between longing and dread. It was difficult to see beyond the childbirth. To be honest, right now it was hard to see beyond the problem of no longer being able to sleep on her stomach. She looked at the luminous dial of the alarm clock. 4:42 a.m. Maybe she should turn on the light and read for a while instead.<br> <br>Three and a half hours and one bad detective novel later, she was about to roll out of bed when the telephone rang shrilly. As usual she handed the receiver to Patrik.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, this is Patrik.&#x201d; His voice was thick with sleep. &#x201c;Okay, all right. Oh shit, yeah, I can be there in fifteen minutes. See you there.&#x201d;<br> <br>He turned to Erica. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got an emergency. I&#x2019;ve got to run.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re on vacation. Can&#x2019;t one of the others take it?&#x201d; She could hear that her voice sounded whiny, but lying awake all night hadn&#x2019;t done much for her mood.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a murder. Mellberg wants me to come along. He&#x2019;s going out there himself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A murder? Where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here in Fj�llbacka. A little boy found a woman&#x2019;s body in the King&#x2019;s Cleft this morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patrik threw on his clothes, which didn&#x2019;t take long since it was the middle of July and he only needed light summer clothes. Before he rushed out the door he climbed onto the bed and kissed Erica on the belly, somewhere near where she vaguely recalled she once had a navel.<br> <br>&#x201c;See you later, baby. Be nice to Mamma, and I&#x2019;ll be home soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>He kissed her quickly on the cheek and hurried off. With a sigh Erica hoisted herself out of bed and put on one of those tentlike dresses that for the time being were the only things that fit her. Against her better judgment she had read lots of baby books, and in her opinion everyone who wrote about the joyful experience of pregnancy ought to be taken out in the public square and horsewhipped. Insomnia, sore joints, stretch marks, hemorrhoids, night sweats and a general hormonal upheaval&#x2014;that was closer to the truth. And she sure as hell wasn&#x2019;t glowing with any inner radiance. Erica muttered to herself as she slowly made her way downstairs in pursuit of the day&#x2019;s first cup of coffee. Maybe that would lift the fog a bit.<br> <br>By the time Patrik arrived, a feverish amount of activity was already under way. The mouth of the King&#x2019;s Cleft had been cordoned off with yellow tape, and he counted three police cars and an ambulance. The techs from Uddevalla were busy with their work and he knew better than to walk right into the crime scene. That was a rookie mistake, which didn&#x2019;t prevent his boss, Superintendent Mellberg, from stomping around among them. They looked in dismay at his shoes and clothing, which at that very moment were adding thousands of fibers and particles to their sensitive workplace. When Patrik stopped outside the tape and motioned to his boss, Mellberg climbed back over the cordon, to the great relief of Forensics.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, Hedstr�m,&#x201d; said the superintendent.<br> <br>His voice was hearty, bordering on joyful, and Patrik was taken aback. For a moment he thought that Mellberg was about to give him a hug but thankfully, this turned out to be wrong. Nevertheless, the man appeared completely changed. It was only a week since Patrik had gone on vacation, but the man before him was really not the same one he&#x2019;d left sitting sullenly at his desk, muttering that the very concept of vacations ought to be abolished.<br> <br>Mellberg eagerly pumped Patrik&#x2019;s hand and slapped him on the back.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, how&#x2019;s it going with the brooding hen at home? Any sign that you&#x2019;re going to be a father soon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not for a month and a half, they say.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patrik still had no idea what had brought on such good humor on Mellberg&#x2019;s part, but he pushed aside his surprise and tried to concentrate on the reason he&#x2019;d been called to the scene.<br> <br>&#x201c;So what have you found?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mellberg made an effort to wipe the smile off his face and pointed toward the shadowy interior of the cleft.<br> <br>&#x201c;A six-year-old boy sneaked out early this morning while his parents were asleep and came here to play knights among the boulders. Instead he found a dead woman. We got the call at six fifteen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long has Forensics had to examine the crime scene?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They arrived an hour ago. The ambulance got here first, and the EMTs were immediately able to confirm that no medical help was needed. Since then they&#x2019;ve been able to work freely. They&#x2019;re a bit touchy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I just wanted to go in and look around a bit and they were quite rude about it, I must say. Well, I suppose one gets a little anal crawling around looking for fibers with tweezers all day long.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now Patrik recognized his boss again. This was more Mellberg&#x2019;s sort of tone. But Patrik knew from experience that it was no use trying to alter his opinions. It was easier just to let his remarks go in one ear and out the other.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do we know about her?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing yet. We think she&#x2019;s around twenty-five. The only item of clothing we found, if you could call it that, was a handbag. Otherwise she was stark naked. Pretty nice tits, actually.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patrik shut his eyes and repeated to himself, like an inner mantra, It won&#x2019;t be long until he retires. It won&#x2019;t be long until he retires&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Mellberg went on obliviously. &#x201c;The cause of death hasn&#x2019;t been confirmed, but she was beaten severely. Bruises all over her body and a number of what look to be knife wounds. And then there&#x2019;s the fact that she&#x2019;s lying on a gray blanket. The medical examiner is having a look at her, and we hope to have a preliminary statement very soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Has anyone been reported missing around that age?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, nowhere near it. An old man was reported missing about a week ago, but it turned out that he just got tired of being cooped up with his wife in a camper and took off with a chick he met at Gal�ren Pub.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patrik saw that the team around the body was now preparing to lift her carefully into a body bag. Her hands and feet had been bagged according to regulations to preserve any evidence. The team of forensic officers from Uddevalla worked together to get the woman into the body bag in the most efficient way possible. Then the blanket she was lying on also had to be put in a plastic bag for later examination.<br> <br>The shocked expression on their faces and the way they froze instantly told Patrik that something unexpected had happened.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he called.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to believe this,&#x201d; said one of the officers, &#x201c;but there are bones here. And two skulls. Based on the number of bones, I&#x2019;d say there are easily enough for two skeletons.&#x201d;</p><h2>Welcome to Junior&#39;s! Remembering Brooklyn With Recipes and Memories from Its Favorite Restaurant</h2><p><p><em>Welcome to Junior's!</em> is a nostalgic tour of Brooklyn from the 1930s to the 1990s with reminiscences and recipes from the legendary restaurant renowned for its rich and creamy cheesecake. Junior's holds a special place in Brooklyn, also home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Coney Island, and the Brooklyn Bridge. As well as a decade-by-decade history of the golden age of Brooklyn with wonderful photographs from the past fifty years, scattered throughout are memories and stories of how Junior's grew from its modest beginnings to its success today.</p><p>From the very first day Junior's opened its doors in 1950 on the corner of DeKalb and Flatbush Avenue Extension in downtown Brooklyn, three generations of the Rosen family have worked hand in hand to build their restaurant into one of the most popular eateries in the borough today. First Harry Rosen, then his sons, Marvin and Walter, and now his grandsons, Kevin and Alan, have worked tirelessly to create and continue a famous Brooklyn neighborhood tradition -- a family restaurant that commands loyalty from its customers, and one to which they return day after day.</p><p>Going to junior's is an event. It is a place that has become a home-away-from-home for Brooklynites over the years and is a popular destination for people from the entire New York metropolitan area. Today, just as on the day it opened, Junior's remains a quintessential Brooklyn phenomenon. It even looks remarkably like it did in the fifties -- bright orange booths that seat nearly four hundred, a glistening counter surrounded with diners, a busy soda fountain, and, of course, the bakery, brimming with all kinds of cheesecakes, homemade pies, towering layer cakes, and buttery pastries. Not only does Junior's stand for the best of ethnic, down-home fare but it also serves the best cheesecake in New York -- at the last count over four million slices each year.</p><p><em>Welcome to Junior's!</em> is not only a memory book to treasure but a cookbook with over one hundred favorite recipes. From Junior's signature cornbread, matzoh ball soup, crisp fried chicken, cheese blintzes, and baked stuffed shrimp to its legendary desserts -- Junior's famous #1 pure cream cheesecake, lemon meringue pie, strawberry shortcake, chocolate fudge layer cake, and ice-cream sundaes -- these recipes allow you to re-create a small slice of Junior's right in your own home kitchen.</p></p><p>Baking quite possibly the best cheesecakes in the universe, Junior's Restaurant is a legend in its own right. Located in downtown Brooklyn, this home away from home has been wooing New Yorkers since it first opened its doors on Election Day, 1950. Three generations of the Rosen family have served up not only cheesecakes, but also a wealth of other diner delicacies, from Brisket Melt to out-of-this-world ice-cream sodas. Written by the sons of founder Harry Rosen, <i>Welcome to Junior's</i> combines slices of Brooklyn's history and culture with fascinating stories, and, thankfully for us, more than 100 recipes, including 7 for cheesecake. Of course, the <i>real</i> cheesecake recipes are a closely guarded secret, but the Rosens share a similar blueprint with us that ensures "you'll soon be experiencing the taste of ecstasy." There are no soggy graham-cracker bases here--just a lovely layer of light sponge-cake, which can be prepared in the home kitchen in five simple steps. Then, a bounty of cheesecake toppings are yours, including fresh blueberries, juicy pineapple, decadent chocolate swirl, and even pumpkin. Lest we forget what else Junior's has to offer, the Rosens share recipes for, among others, Baked Meat Loaf with Mushroom Sauce, French Fried Onion Rings, even Matzoh Ball Soup. <p> Junior's is much more than a diner; it is an experience, an urban retreat where good old-fashioned service still exists, where fantastic food is a guarantee, and where regulars and newcomers are all welcome. If you can't make it there in person, let <i>Welcome to Junior's</i> transport you there with words. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p><p>Walter and Marvin Rosen, the sons of Junior's founder, Harry Rosen, have been actively involved with developing and running this family-owned institution.</p></p><h2>Transformative Assessment</h2><p>If you&#39;re at all skeptical that &#34;formative assessment&#34; is just another buzzword, then here s a book that will change the way you think about the role that formative assessment can play in transforming education into a more powerful and positive process.

This approach avoids the highly distressing exposure component of exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP) that is commonly used to treat the symptoms of OCD. Not only does this cognitive therapy (CT) approach open up the option of psychotherapy to those OCD sufferers who resist exposure-based therapy, it also holds great promise for treating OCD sufferers with mental rituals as well as those who struggle concurrently with depression, anxiety, and other symptoms.</p> <p>The strategies described in this book focus intensively on the intrusive thoughts that can trigger negative beliefs and drive compulsive behaviors. The manual begins with a brief review of current facts about OCD. Then it describes how cognitive therapy can be applied to OCD. The several treatment modules that follow outline a brief three-to-four session approach therapists can use to help clients make real progress on their OCD beliefs and behavioral symptoms. Each module is complemented by a series of client worksheets and handouts.</p> <p>This purely cognitive approach to OCD offers a number of benefits including:</p> �CT avoids the discomfort of prolonged exposure and response prevention (ERP)<br> �The therapy can be conducted entirely in the therapist's office<br> �CT is especially useful for patients with mental rituals and neutralizing strategies<br> �The treatment is based on NIMH-funded research and is empirically supported<br> <p></p></p><p>Two noted psychologists offer therapists the first purely cognitive treatment method for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which has been proven effective for people with pure obsessions, harming, religious, and sexual obsessions, as well as checking and mental rituals.Sabine Wilhelm, PhD, is associate professor of psychology at the Harvard Medical School and director of the Cognitive Behavior Therapy Program and clinical director of the Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Clinic, at Massachusetts General Hospital.<br><br> Gail Steketee, PhD, is a professor and co-chair in the department of clinical practice at the School of Social Work at Boston University.

Since the 1900s, large-scale agricultural enterprises relied on migrant labor-a cheap, unorganized, and powerless workforce. In 1965, when some 800 Filipino grape workers began to strike under the aegis of the AFL-CIO, the UFW soon joined the action with 2,000 Mexican workers and turned the strike into a civil rights struggle. They engaged in civil disobedience, mobilized support from churches and students, boycotted growers, and transformed their struggle into <em>La Causa</em>, a farm workers' movement that eventually triumphed over the grape industry's Goliath. Why did they succeed? How can the powerless challenge the powerful successfully? Offering insight from a longtime movement organizer and scholar, Ganz illustrates how they had the ability and resourcefulness to devise good strategy and turn short-term advantages into long-term gains. Authoritative in scholarship and magisterial in scope, this book constitutes a seminal contribution to learning from the movement's struggles, set-backs, and successes.<br><br>"A brilliant new book."-Peter Dreier, The Nation<br><br>"Why David Sometimes Wins is an exceptional book that will be of widespread interest to scholars and activists alike."-Howard Kimeldorf, American Journal of Sociology<br><br>"This book is a must read for organizers.

In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, William Allan explores what the "classics" are and why they continue to shape our Western concepts of literature. Presenting a range of material from both Greek and Latin literature, he illustrates the variety and sophistication of these works, and considers examples from all major genres. <br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br>Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

They always had. At Eton: two<br>nights locked in a broom closet. At Oxford, they laughed, they did, the<br>horsefaced girls and the cooing boys. And dear Papa, Lord of the Manor,<br>Chancellor of the Purse Strings. All that school and you a bloody office boy.<br><br>But underestimated is close to unnoticed.<br><br>Heap capitalized on that.<br><br>She could be any girl who struck his fancy.<br><br>Eye the herd.<br><br>Cull.<br><br>The bright-eyed brunette in Brussels.<br><br>Her virtual twin in Barcelona.<br><br>The early work, glorious countryside afternoons, honing his technique.<br><br>The unmistakable tingle came on him like a fit of sick. Though Heap<br>wasn&#x2019;t fool enough to deny that he preferred a certain species: dark hair,<br>sharp features. Lower class, not too bright, not bad-looking but well shy<br>of pretty.<br><br>Smallish body, except he demanded a big chest. The soft, yielding<br>pressure never failed to excite.<br><br>This one was perfect.<br><br>He had first spotted her walking east along the Charles Bridge.<br>He&#x2019;d been skulking round for two weeks by then, taking in the sights,<br>waiting for an opportunity to present itself. He liked Prague. He&#x2019;d visited<br>before and never left disappointed.<br><br>Among the jean-clad magpies, the wattled American tourists, the<br>leather-voiced buskers, and the minimally talented portrait artists, she had<br>stood out for her modesty. Limp skirt, tight hair, focused and grim, she<br>hurried along, cheeks carved out by the midmorning glare off the Vltava.<br><br>Perfect.<br><br>He tried to follow her but she melted into the crowd. The next day, he<br>returned, hopeful, prepared, attentive. Opening his guidebook, he pretended<br>to reread a gray box headed Did you know? The bridge had eggs<br>mixed into its concrete for added strength. Good King Charles IV had<br>commandeered every last egg in the kingdom, and they had obeyed, the<br>stupid, slobbering masses, showing up to place them obsequiously at his<br>royal feet.<br><br>Did Heap know?<br><br>Yes, he did. He knew everything worth knowing and much besides.<br><br>Even the guidebook underestimated him.<br><br>She passed again at the same time. And the day after that. Three days<br>running he watched her. A girl of fixed habits. Lovely.<br><br>Her first stop was a caf� near the bridge. She donned a red apron,<br>cleared tables for change. At dusk, she left Old Town for New Town,<br>exchanged the red apron for a black one, bussing trays and refilling steins<br>at a beer hall that, by the smell of it, catered to the locals. Photos of the<br>entr�es in the window showed sausages smothered in that vile, muddy<br>sauce they put on everything.<br><br>From beneath the trolley stand, Heap watched her flit here and there.<br>Twice passersby paused to ask him a question in Czech, which Heap<br>took to mean that he appeared, as ever, unremarkable. He replied, in<br>French, that he spoke no Czech.<br><br>At midnight, the girl finished mopping up. She doused the restaurant&#x2019;s<br>lights, and a few minutes later, a window two floors up blinked<br>yellow, and her pale arm drew the blind.<br><br>It would be a squalid rented room, then. A sad and hopeless life.<br><br>Delicious.<br><br>He considered finding a way into her flat. Blitzing her in her own<br>bedroom.<br><br>Appealing notion. But Heap despised senseless risk. It came of watching<br>Papa burn thousands on football, cricket, anything involving imbeciles<br>and a ball, pouring the fortune of centuries down the grimy throats<br>of bookmakers. Never the most discriminating chap, Papa. How he<br>loved to remind Heap that it would all be gone before Heap saw a penny.<br>Heap was nothing like him and therefore deserved nothing.<br><br>Someday Heap would let him know what he thought of that.<br><br>To the task at hand: no sense changing the pattern. The pattern<br>worked. He&#x2019;d take her on the street like the others.<br><br>Leaving an empty-eyed shell propped against a dustbin or a wall,<br>waiting to be discovered by some privileged citizen of the free world.<br><br>Heap examined an unmarked door to the right of the restaurant, six<br>anonymous buzzer pushes. Never mind her name. He preferred to think<br>of them numerically. Easier to catalog. He had the librarian&#x2019;s spirit in<br>him, he did. She would be number nine.<br><br>On the seventh night, a Thursday, Number Nine went up to her<br>room as usual but reemerged soon after, a feather duster in one hand, a<br>folded square of white cloth in the other.<br><br>He gave her slack, then followed north as she crossed into Old Town<br>Square, uncomfortably alive with pedestrians. He clung to shadows on<br>Maiselova as they entered Josefov, the former Jewish quarter.<br><br>He had come this way days before, while reacquainting himself with<br>the city. It was the thing to do, see the old Jewish places. Dutifully he<br>had elbowed through the revolting gawking swarms, tour guides prattling<br>about Slavic tolerance while their charges snap snap snapped away.<br>Heap didn&#x2019;t care enough about Jews as a group to summon genuine<br>loathing. He regarded them with the same contempt he had for all lesser<br>humanity, which included everyone except himself and a select few.<br>Those Jews he&#x2019;d known at school were self-satisfied twits laboring to be<br>more Christian than the Christians.<br><br>The girl turned right at a shambling yellow wreck of a building. The<br>Old-New Synagogue. Curious name to go along with a curious design.<br>Part Gothic, part Renaissance, the result a rather clumsy porridge, homely<br>crenellated roof and skimpy windows. Far more old than new. But then<br>Prague had no end of old buildings. They were common as streetwalkers.<br>He&#x2019;d drunk his fill.<br><br>An alleyway unfurled along the synagogue&#x2019;s south side, ending at a<br>wide set of ten steps that in turn ran up to the shuttered shops of Par� sk�<br>Street. Heap wondered if Nine was headed there, to tidy up at one of<br>the boutiques.<br><br>Instead she went left at the foot of the steps, disappearing behind the<br>synagogue. Heap crept along the alley in crepe-soled shoes, reaching the<br>steps and stealing a glance.<br><br>She stood on a small cobbled terrace, facing the rear of the synagogue,<br>into which was set an arched iron door, rudely studded. A trio of rubbish<br>bins constituted the exterior decor. She had flapped open the white cloth<br>and was tying it around her waist: yet another apron. Heap smiled to<br>imagine her closet, nothing but aprons in every color. So many secret<br>identities she had, each more wretched than the last.<br><br>She picked up the feather duster from where she&#x2019;d laid it, against the<br>wall. She shook it out. Shook her head, as well, as if banishing drowsiness.<br><br>Industrious little charwoman. Two full-time jobs and now this.<br><br>Who said the work ethic was dead?<br><br>He might have taken her right then, but a duet of drunken laughter<br>came bounding along Par� sk�, and Heap continued slowly up the steps,<br>watching the girl peripherally.<br>She withdrew a key from her jeans and let herself into the synagogue<br>through the iron door. The lock clanked.<br><br>He took up a vigil beneath a lamppost, opposite the synagogue&#x2019;s dark<br>visage. A series of metal rungs in the brick ran up to a second arched<br>door, a shabby wooden echo of the iron one, thirty-five feet off the<br>ground and opening illogically onto thin air.<br><br>The garret. Did you know? There, the world-famous (according<br>to whom, Heap wondered) Rabbi Loew had conjured the golem, a<br>mythical mud-creature who roamed the ghetto, protecting its inhabitants.<br>The selfsame rabbi had a statue of himself in a grand square, he<br>did. While following the girl, Heap had pretended to stop and take its<br>picture.<br><br>Hideously undignified, really. Mud was one step above shit.<br><br>The legend had become the wellspring of a gaudy commercialism, the<br>monster&#x2019;s lumpy form cropping up on signs and menus, mugs and pennants.<br>In one particularly rank bistro near Heap&#x2019;s hotel you could buy a<br>brown-sauce-soaked Golem Burger and wash it down with Golemtinis<br>enough to rot your liver.<br><br>People would pay for anything.<br><br>People were disgusting.<br><br>The laughter of the couple had faded in the warm wind.<br><br>Heap decided to give it one more night. More foreplay made for a<br>better climax.<br><br>Friday evening, the Old-New was a busy place, worshippers filing in,<br>some stopping to talk to a blond man stationed out front with a<br>walkie-talkie. With smiles all around, and everyone afforded entry, the<br>attempt at security struck Heap as a bit of a sham.<br><br>Nevertheless he&#x2019;d come prepared, his better suit (his only decent suit<br>since Papa had screwed tight the tap), a mild white shirt, and his old<br>school tie, plus inoffensive flat-lensed specs. Approaching the entrance,<br>he hunched to take off some height, blousing his jacket, eliminating the<br>bulge of his inside pocket.<br><br>The blond guard was more of a boy, hardly out of nappies. He shifted<br>his body to block Heap&#x2019;s progress, addressing him in a throaty, vulgar<br>accent. &#x201c;Can I help you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to pray,&#x201d; Heap said.<br><br>&#x201c;Pray,&#x201d; the guard said, as if that were the strangest reason to visit a<br>house of worship.<br><br>&#x201c;You know. Give thanks. Praise God.&#x201d; Heap smiled. &#x201c;Perhaps it&#x2019;ll<br>help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Help?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;World a mess and all that.&#x201d;<br><br>The guard studied him. &#x201c;You want to come into the shul ?&#x201d;<br><br>Dense little turd. &#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To pray for the world.&#x201d;<br><br>Heap lowered the level a few notches. &#x201c;That and personal good fortune,<br>mate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are Jewish?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here, am I not?&#x201d;<br><br>The guard smiled. &#x201c;Please, you can tell me: what is the last holiday?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The most recent Jewish holiday.&#x201d;<br><br>A furious moment while Heap ransacked the files. A light sweat broke<br>out on his forehead. He resisted the urge to wipe it away. Aware that he<br>was taking an awfully long time, he coughed up what he had. &#x201c;Well,<br>then, that would be Passover, would it not?&#x201d;<br><br>The guard said, &#x201c;Passover.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Reckon so, yes.&#x201d;<br><br>The guard said, &#x201c;You are British.&#x201d;<br><br>There&#x2019;s a clever lad. Heap nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;I can see your passport, please?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One wouldn&#x2019;t think one would need it to pray.&#x201d;<br><br>The guard made a show of taking out his keys and locking the synagogue<br>door. He gave Heap a condescending pat on the shoulder. &#x201c;Wait<br>here, please.&#x201d;<br><br>He sauntered off down the street, murmuring into his walkie-talkie<br>while Heap swam in the red tide of his mind. The sheer nerve: to touch<br>him. He puffed his chest against the bulge. Stag bone handle. Six-inch<br>blade. Ought to give thanks of your own, mate.<br><br>Twenty yards hence, the guard stopped at a doorway. A second man<br>materialized and the two of them conferred, appraising him openly. The<br>sweat kept oozing. Sometimes the sweat was a problem. A drop ran in<br>Heap&#x2019;s eye and stung and he blinked it away. He knew when he wasn&#x2019;t<br>wanted. He could be patient. He left the guards talking and went on<br>his way.<br><br>Every man has his limits, though. After six more days without a<br>fair chance, he was aroused to the brink of madness, and he decided that<br>tonight would be the night, come what may, and how lovely it would be.<br><br>By three a.m., she&#x2019;d been inside the synagogue for over two hours.<br>Heap slouched in darkness near the steps, listening to distant bleats from<br>somewhere well beyond the Jewish quarter, rolling the knife handle between<br>his fingers. He began to wonder if she&#x2019;d snuck in a brief nap. Busy<br>girl, she must be falling off her feet.<br><br>The iron door screamed on its hinges.<br><br>Number Nine stepped out toting a sizable plastic tub. She turned her<br>back to him, headed for the rubbish bins, hoisted the tub and dumped it<br>out noisily, clanking cans and rushing paper, and he unfolded the blade<br>(oiled and silent, a welcome release it was, like his lungs filling with fresh<br><br>air) and moved on her.<br><br>Halfway to her, a muffled clap froze him in panic.<br><br>He glanced back.<br><br>The alley was empty.<br><br>As for the girl, she hadn&#x2019;t noticed the noise; she continued about her<br>business, raking out the last of the rubbish with her fingers.<br><br>She set the tub down.<br><br>She untied her hair and began to regather it, and her raised arms<br>formed a wide-hipped lyre, oh lovely lovely shape, and his blood boiled<br>afresh and he started forward again. Too eager: his shoe caught the cobblestone<br>and sent a pebble clicking toward her and she went rigid and<br>turned, her mouth already poised to scream.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t have time enough before his hand mashed against her lips<br>and he twirled her, her back to his belly and his stiffening prick. Practical<br>hardworking girl, she kept her nails cut short; hard rounded calluses<br>clawed ineffectually at his arms and face before a deeper prey instinct<br>took hold of her and she sought his instep to stomp it.<br><br>He was ready. Number Four, Edinburgh, had done the same. A sharp<br>little heel; a broken metatarsal; a good pair of loafers, ruined. Heap had<br>learned his lesson. He had his feet splayed as he braced against her. He<br>twined his fingers in her hair and yanked her head back to form a graceful<br>convexity of her gullet.<br><br>He reached up to stroke the blade.<br><br>But she was a resourceful lass, and it seemed she must have fingernails<br>after all, because she made a spittly hiss and he felt a hideous stab in his<br>eye, like an awl driving through the lens and the jelly to scrape his optic<br>nerve. False colors gushed. The pain made him gag and loosen his grip<br>on her hair and his hand went up to protect his face. He had prey instincts,<br>too.<br><br>Her distorted form broke away from him and ran for the steps.<br><br>Groaning, he lurched forth, grabbing at her.<br><br>Another hiss; another stab of pain, his other eye, driving him stumbling<br>into the rubbish bins, both eyes streaming, the knife flung from<br>his hands. He could not understand. Had she shot him? Thrown something<br>at him? He blinked forcefully to clear the blurriness and he saw the<br>girl reaching the top of the steps, disappearing round the corner onto<br>Par� sk�, and her waning form brought the awareness of a dawning<br>catastrophe.<br><br>She had seen his face.<br><br>He struggled to his feet and started after her, and from behind he<br>heard a hiss and pain knocked him flat, as if someone had buried a claw<br>hammer in the base of his skull, and as he pitched against the hard<br>ground, his fine roaring brain grasped that something was happening to<br>him, something wrong, because the girl was long gone.<br><br>Sprawled on his stomach in scattered rubbish, he opened his tearing<br>eyes and saw it, half a foot away, a coin-sized spot, glittering blackly on<br>the cobblestones.<br><br>A hard-domed insect, shimmering antennae, long black thorn sprouting<br>from its head.<br><br>It charged him, driving itself into the center of Heap&#x2019;s forehead.<br><br>He screamed and swatted at it and tried to stand up, but the thing<br>kept coming at him, fast and vicious, the growl of its wings audible in<br>every direction, like a cattle prod touched to Heap&#x2019;s neck, his spine, the<br>backs of his knees, herding him away from the steps and backing him<br>into the wall of the synagogue, where he balled up with his arms thrown<br>over his head.<br><br>Abruptly, the assault broke off, and the nigh...</p><h2>Jumbo Easy Piano Songbook: 200 Songs for All Occasions</h2><p>(Easy Piano Songbook).

The volume includes insightful literary criticism alongside autobiographical anecdotes, revelations about the origins of the author's books, and reflections about the life of an author and the value of writing for young people. </p><p><em>Reflections</em> features the author's final interview, a foreword by award-winning author Neil Gaiman, and an introduction by Charlie Butler, a senior lecturer in English at the University of West England in Bristol. </p></p><p><p>In a career spanning four decades, award-winning author Diana Wynne Jones (1934&#x2012;2011) wrote more than forty books of fantasy for young readers. Characterized by magic, multiple universes, witches and wizards&#x2014;and a charismatic nine-lived enchanter&#x2014;her books are filled with unlimited imagination, dazzling plots, and an effervescent sense of humor that earned her legendary status in the world of fantasy.</p>Putting her papers together in the face of her impending death, Jones chose and arranged these lectures, articles, and reviews written between 1978 and 2008 to encapsulate her beliefs about writing, writing for children, and fantasy. Ranging from literary criticism to autobiography, the 28 pieces illustrate her insight, her humor, and the mastery of her craft. She describes how magic and humor work, discusses the nature of heroes, the uses of mythology, and the value of learning Anglo-Saxon. Other selections reflect on the magic of the "Narnia" books, the nature of "Real Books," and the orchestration of a narrative. Because this volume is a gathering of pieces written over many years, topics and episodes are repeated, like recurring melodies in a long piece of music. One of the most important themes is that humans-children and adults-need fantasy. In some ways, her entire oeuvre is a reaction to a childhood in which fantasy literature was denied, as revealed in the long essay she wrote for Something About the Author and included here. An interview with the book's editor, Charlie Butler, and reminiscences by two of her sons wrap up the collection. Readers who have known and loved the author's vast body of work will nod and laugh, rejoice that they can return to works like the "Chrestomanci" series, and mourn the fact that there will be no more.-Kathleen Isaacs, Children's Literature Specialist, Pasadena, MD&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Vatican documents, including one authored by the present Pope when he was Cardinal Ratzinger, have highlighted the spiritual dangers associated with methods of meditation associated with Eastern religions. Despite these warnings Yoga, Tai Chi and Reiki continue to be promoted in parishes, schools and religious orders. Max Sculley&#39;s detailed and well documented analysis of Yoga, Tai Chi and Reika includes gripping personal stories that bring home the dark side of these practices.

Narrator George Wilson starts with a quote from Winston Churchill, whom he mimics: "War is mainly a catalog of blunders." The tactical mistakes made by Admiral Halsey and his foe, Admiral Kurita, dominate the story. Wilson keeps the narrative vital and exciting, using every bit of the action to maximize excitement for the listener. He uses dramatized voices for many of the historical figures--including Tokyo Rose--and describes the kamikaze attacks and torpedo hits with the restrained authority of a seasoned commander.

With the exception of a few dance recordings, including &#x201c;Is It All Over My Face?&#x201d; and &#x201c;Go Bang! #5,&#x201d; Russell&#x2019;s pioneering music was largely forgotten until 2004, when the posthumous release of two albums brought new attention to the artist. This revival of interest gained momentum with the issue of additional albums and the documentary film <i>Wild Combination</i>.

Resisting definition while dreaming of commercial success, Russell wrote and performed new wave and disco as well as quirky rock, twisted folk, voice-cello dub, and hip-hop-inflected pop. &#x201c;He was way ahead of other people in understanding that the walls between concert music and popular music and avant-garde music were illusory,&#x201d; comments the composer Philip Glass. &#x201c;He lived in a world in which those walls weren&#x2019;t there.&#x201d; Lawrence follows Russell across musical genres and through such vital downtown music spaces as the Kitchen, the Loft, the Gallery, the Paradise Garage, and the Experimental Intermedia Foundation. Along the way, he captures Russell&#x2019;s openness to sound, his commitment to collaboration, and his uncompromising idealism.</p></p><p>"With rich and animated detail, Tim Lawrence tracks Arthur Russell's insatiable drive to integrate so-called serious music and pop. This definitive biography is both an engrossing record of Russell's musical ambitions and a compelling account of the fertile downtown scene that supported his admirable dreams."--<b>Matt Wolf</b>, director of <i>Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell</i> <p> "Tim Lawrence has written a fascinating and insightful biography of a sensitive and searching soul. Arthur Russell was a personal artist whose musical vision led him to coexist in seemingly incompatible worlds. Through the lens of Arthur Russell's life (never clouded with material success nor celebrity), Tim Lawrence gives us a sharp and singular portrait of the late-twentieth-century American life. A fine read, with a depth and detail that resonate with Arthur Russell's sparkle and wit."--<b>Peter Gordon</b>, Love of Life Orchestra</p>&#34;&#34;Hold On to Your Dreams&#34; tells the story of an artist whose life becomes more intriguing with every turn. Inspiring and written with love, this book takes us to the roots of Arthur Russell&#39;s music, from the streets of New York to the cornfields of Iowa.&#34;--Jens Lekman, musician</p><h2>Women in the Viking Age</h2><p>Well-illustrated, closely argued and fascinating. GUARDIAN This is the first book-length study in English to investigate what women did in the Viking age, both at home in Scandinavia and in the Viking colonies from Greenland to Russia. Evidence for their lives is fragmentary, but Judith Jesch assembles the clues provided by archaeology, runic inscriptions, place names and personal names, foreign historical records and Old Norse literature and mythology. These sources illuminate different aspects of women&#39;s lives in the Viking age, on the farms and in the trading centres of Scandinavia, abroad on Viking expeditions, and as settlers in places such as Iceland and the British Isles. Women in the Viking Age explores anunfamiliar aspect of medieval history and offers a new perspective on Viking society, very different from the traditional picture of a violent and male-dominated world. JUDITH JESCH is Reader in Viking Studies at the University of Nottingham.</p><p>Women in the Viking Age explores an unfamiliar aspect of medieval history, and offers a new perspective on viking society, very different from the traditional image of a violent and male-dominated world.JUDITH JESCH is Reader in Viking Studies at the University of Nottingham.</p><h2>Living Deeply: The Art and Science of Transformation in Everyday Life</h2><p><p><strong>Living Deeply</strong> transcends any one approach by focusing on common elements of transformation across a variety of traditions, while affirming and supporting the diversity of approaches across religious, spiritual, scientific, academic, and cultural backgrounds.

Band re-formations and reunion tours, expanded reissues of classic albums and outtake-crammed box sets, remakes and sequels, tribute albums and mash-ups . . . But what happens when we run out of past? Are we heading toward a sort of culturalecological catastrophe where the archival stream of pop history has been exhausted? </p><p>Simon Reynolds, one of the finest music writers of his generation, argues that we have indeed reached a tipping point, and that although earlier eras had their own obsessions with antiquity&#x2015;the Renaissance with its admiration for Roman and Greek classicism, the Gothic movement's invocations of medievalism&#x2015;never has there been a society so obsessed with the cultural artifacts of its own immediate past. <i>Retromania </i>is the first book to examine the retro industry and ask the question: Is this retromania a death knell for any originality and distinctiveness of our own?</p></p><p><p><b>Simon Reynolds</b> is a music critic whose writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times, The Village Voice, Spin, Rolling Stone</i>, and <i>Artforum.</i> He is the author of five previous books, including <i>Rip It Up and Start Again.</i></p>Retromania <br> 1: 'NOW' 1 POP WILL REPEAT ITSELF Museums, Reunions, Rock Docs, Re-enactments &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> At the outset I should make a confession: my gut feeling is that pop and the museum just don't go together. Actually, I'm not sure music of any kind really works in a museum, a place of hush and decorum. Museums are primarily visual, oriented around display, designed for the contemplative gaze. The crucial element of sound has either to be absent or suppressed. Unlike paintings or sculptures, you can't have sonic exhibits side by side; they interfere with each other. So music museums contain the ancillary stuff (instruments and stage costumes, posters and packaging) but not the main thing itself. Ephemera, not what's essential. But it's also true that a museum - a becalmed resting place for works of art considered to have passed the test of time - is opposed to the vital energies of pop and rock. I'm with Nik Cohn here: writing at the end of the sixties, anxious about the art aspirations and respectability of recent rock, which boded a future of seated audiences 'applauding politely', his book <i>Awopbopaloobopalopbamboom</i> was an elegiac celebration of 'Superpop, the noise machine, and the image, hype and beautiful flash of rock'n'roll music'. Pop is about the momentary thrill; it can't be a permanent exhibit. Walking towards the British Music Experience, the UK's bignew rock museum, on a weekday morning in August 2009, for a moment I think maybe, just maybe they've got the right idea. The museum is housed inside London's gigantic O2 entertainment complex, and the route across the plaza towards the silver bubble-dome takes you past gigantic blown-up photographs from the key stages of pop history: frozen moments of frenzy and delirium from Beatlemania and Bay City Rollermania, through snarling punks, shrieking Durannies to metal monsters and Madchester ravers. My big worry, with rock museums, is always punk: that rift in rock time that consigned the Old Wave to History's dustbin. Can such an apocalyptic rupture be contained within the filing system of an archive and still retain its essence, the truth of its ruthlessness? Passing a roller-disco busy with pubescent girls whizzing around in glee and a pair of giant-size cutouts of Jarvis Cocker and Dizzee Rascal pointing me in the right direction, I reach the British Music Experience itself. To maintain a steady flow of visitors, punters are admitted at intervals, so we loiter in an anteroom which doubles as a gift shop. Just as we're about to be let in, 'Anarchy in the UK' comes over the sound system, right on cue to renew my uneasiness. Before you get to the main exhibition area, you watch a short introductory film about how to get the most out of your Experience experience. 'Like rock'n'roll, there are no rules' but there is a timeline you can refer to 'in case you get lost in music'. Finally inside the Experience proper, my first impression is that it's been designed to mimic netspace. Instead of the high ceilings and empty spaces of a traditional museum, the British Music Experience is dim and intimate, with every corner flickering with LED activity. There's a central hub area surrounded by Edge Zones, rooms that each represent a chunk of British pop time (1966 - 70, or 1976 - 85, or ...). So you can proceed through them in chronological sequence (in a clockwise circle) or criss-cross thecentral concourse randomly, putting History into shuffle mode. In another Web 2.0 attempt to update and pep up the museum experience, the far interior wall of each room features a projected gallery of icons indicating specific performers, albums, events, trends, which you can scroll through and click on to find out more. A subdued clamour fills the hub zone, mingling leakage of music from the seven chambers with the sound from various interactive displays in the central area. So you feel like you're immersed not just in electronic light but in a trans-temporal mush of music: 'Relax' + 'Rock Island Line' + 'West End Girls' + 'What Do I Get' + _____. Each pop-period room features Table Talk: four chairs with video screens on the backrest arrayed around a table, with each screen displaying an interview segment. So in the first Edge Zone you can eavesdrop on a sort of virtual dinner party attended by veterans of the early days of British rock'n'roll - Vince Eager, Joe Brown, Cliff Richard, Marty Wilde - where the main topic of conversation is the impact of Elvis in the UK. Still, if you subtract the flashy state-of-the-art stuff, most of the Experience is fundamentally identical to what you get at an old-fashioned museum. Instead of cabinets of ethnological curiosities or stuffed animals, behind the glass you have relics from the world of UK pop and rock: instruments, stage clothes, concert posters, sheet music and record covers. In the fifties room that means things like a handbill for a musical boat cruise (the Floating Festival of Jazz) that went from London to Margate and back in 1958, or Johnny Kidd of the Pirates' black eyepatch. In the sixties room you get the Beatles frock worn by usherettes at the premiere of <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>, or the sitar played by Justin Hayward on The Moody Blues' <i>In Search of the Lost Chord</i>. After glam (Bowie's Thin White Duke outfit complete with Gitanes in the waistcoat pocket, etc.) punk is next. The introductory plaqueinforms the viewer, sensibly, that punk was 'shocking, novel and subversive'. Naturally none of this insurrectionary energy is transmitted by the lifeless objects on display: Pete Shelley's broken-in-twain Starway guitar, a Stranglers set list, and so forth. Scrolling through the scores of punk-related topics projected onto the wall, I click on one icon that does gesture at the earth-shaking impact of 1977: 'Music Press Struggle to Nail the Essence of Punk'. Apparently the British rock papers couldn't 'quite create a satisfactory new language and scale of values to assess punk, so still employ their old values', resulting in The Clash being dubbed 'the new Beatles', The Jam as 'the new Who', The Stranglers as 'the new Doors', and so forth. These specific examples may be true, but it's odd that this is the only place where the museum acknowledges the music papers' existence, and not only does it downplay their role as a cultural agent, it argues that the British music press got punk <i>wrong</i>. Actually, it would be closer to historical truth to say that the UK weeklies - <i>NME</i>, <i>Sounds</i>, <i>Melody Maker</i> - were the prime arena in which punk could dramatise itself, given that many gigs were banned and radio play was minimal. So the music press was actually the forum in which the meaning of punk was thrashed out, fought over and disseminated across the country and around the world. The rock media not only documented history in real time (they were newspapers, whereas museums can only be about 'the olds'), they actually helped to make that history, to be a real creative force within it. The jibe at the music papers reminded me of a famous singles-review column by the <i>NME</i>'s punk-era firebrand Julie Burchill. Written in October 1980, when diehard believer Burchill was embittered and disillusioned, the column starts with the declaration: 'There are two ways to view music. One is with tunnel vision, what I've got. If a record isn't by the Sex Pistols or Tamla Motown ... it's just pointless. But how unhealthy! I'm just a cranky old punk past its prime. But the alternative is hideous, and it is theonly alternative. It is to believe in ROCK'S RICH TAPESTRY.' Alluding to a TV series called <i>History of Rock</i> that left out the Pistols, Burchill accused: 'There can only be one reason ... <i>fear</i>. Everyone just wants to forget the whole nasty thing and get back to leading a normal life ... So many smug saps think they're rebels, but anything that can fit into ROCK'S RICH TAPESTRY is dead at heart.' Rock (and rock writing) was always energised and focused by being <i>against</i>. But animosity, the sort of polarised vision that fuelled Burchill's snarling, strident rhetoric, has gone now, everywhere. Rock museums like the British Music Experience represent the triumph of the Tapestry, with even the most troubling threads, like The Sex Pistols, neatly woven into its fabric. The Old Wave/New Wave war is distant history, and that's the point of the rock museum: it presents music with the battle lines erased, everything wrapped up in a warm blanket of acceptance and appreciation. So Johnny Rotten, middle-aged and mellow now, admits that despite the 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt that got him the job as Sex Pistols singer, he always liked the Floyd (not just the Syd Barrett-era stuff but <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>). And Elvis Costello, the nasty New Waver who once said abhorrent things just to wind up decrepit American hippies Stephen Stills and Bonnie Bramlett, can be found on TV hosting his show <i>Spectacle</i>, where he interviews the likes of James Taylor and Elton John and finds amiable common ground in a shared love of American roots music and singer-songwriter balladry. Next I plunge into the eighties room, which contains indie (The Smiths et al.), metal (Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, etc.) and Hacienda-era Manchester. The final Edge Zone contains most of the nineties and all of the 2000s, which means that Britpop and the Brit female boom (Amy Winehouse, Kate Nash, Adele, Duffy et al.) are crammed together with The Spice Girls and the Brit Awards (both of which get a glass case each). British 'urban' music(mostly meaning grime) is dealt with as Table Talk: MCs Dizzee Rascal, Kano and D Double E &amp; Footsie chat about the 'recently evolved genre' and tease the other guest at the table, the BBC's veteran rap DJ Tim Westwood, for 'sleeping on grime'. It's striking that this last room, which feels cursory and rushed, covers a sixteen-year period, whereas the four-year stretches of 1962 - 6 and 1966 - 70 get a whole chamber each. The covert argument of the museum's structure would appear to be that any single year in the sixties was approximately four times more exciting than any year in the last decade and a half. Not that I disagree. And that bias probably mirrors the outlook of the average BME visitor, who leans towards middle age rather than youth. Museums, by definition, can't have that much room for the present. But the Experience website had actually promised a final Edge Zone, a whole space dedicated to the future and the question of where music might go next. I must have missed it, though, because after the 1993 - Present room I find myself back in the gift shop. On the way out, I notice a giant cut-out pop-star figure directing visitors to the museum that I didn't see on the way in: Johnny Rotten in all his safety-pinned glory. In my head I hear him singing, ' <i>No future, no future/ No future for you.</i>' LIBRARIANS OF ROCK A few days later I visit what's meant to be a punk-rock response to the British Music Experience: the Rock'n'Roll Public Library. For five weeks in the late summer of 2009, former Clash guitarist Mick Jones is throwing open to the general public his personal archive of memorabilia, which is kept in a suite of Ladbroke Grove offices tucked directly under the Westway dual carriage-way. Access is free (although for �10 you can buy a memory stick and scan in pages from the magazines, books and other printed material on display). The press release for the Rock'n'Roll PublicLibrary trumpets Jones's generosity as a 'direct artistic challenge to the likes of the corporate O2 British Music Experience' and advises visitors that despite the exhibition's sedate name, they should not 'expect peace and quiet'. Actually, it is pretty quiet in there when I drop by at noontime on Saturday, the Portobello vintage-clothing market in full swing directly below. And it doesn't feel like a challenge to anything in particular, this cosy clutter of souvenirs and keepsakes, the detritus of a life spent rocking and rolling. Clash/punk-related artifacts (dusty amps, a Watkins Copicat effects box, a hand-drawn tour map from 1982 titled Rat Patrol Over South East Asia &amp; Australia) jostle alongside bric-a-brac of the kind you'd find at the flea market on the other side of the road: vintage cameras, radios and Super-8 equipment, a Spike Milligan annual, a Diana Dors gatefold. In tune with The Clash's fascination with military glory, the walls are decorated with nineteenth-century watercolours of battle scenes and images from World War II, such as a print of US marines raising the Stars and Stripes on Iwo Jima. Give or take the odd youngster, the visitors are mostly veterans of the punk wars. There's a middle-aged couple, the woman plump and with a purple streak in her hair, the guy wearing a Pistols T-shirt and a bedraggled Mohawk. And there's an endless supply of guys who all seem to wear the cowboy-like hats that The Clash and Big Audio Dynamite favoured. One of these stupid-hat diehards - a Mancunian Clash fan - sits down beside me and, already quite drunk even though it's not lunchtime yet, regales me with stories of climbing onstage at a Clash gig and being invited to play the A, E and G chords. Eventually I make my excuses and slope off into a side-room that's like a cavern of pop periodicals: issues of <i>Crawdaddy!</i> and <i>Trouser Press</i>, <i>CREEM</i> and <i>ZigZag</i>, squeezed into see-through bags and pinned neatly to the walls. Pumping at moderate volume out of speakers all through theoffice space there's a Radio Clash-style stream of Mick Jones's favourite tunes. 'Memo from Turner', a Mick Jagger song from the soundtrack to <i>Performance</i>, comes on. I flash on The Clash's the-time-is-NOW anthem '1977', with its iconoclastic chorus 'No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones in 1977', then notice the signed poster for the Beatles Royal Command Performance at the London Palladium in 1963, the framed photo of the young Jagger and Richards. But The Clash long ago stitched themselves into a corner of Rock's Rich Tapestry - as early as <i>London Calling</i>, which re-rooted punk in the riches of rock'n'roll and Americana, and was duly anointed Greatest Album of the Eighties by <i>Rolling Stone</i>. Browsing the Rock'n'Roll Public Library, I think back to seeing Mick Jones on TV in 2003, when The Clash were getting inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The latter, co-founded by <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s Jann Wenner, is not just an awards ceremony but the world's first rock museum: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, which opened in 1995 and is based in Cleveland. At the 2003 ceremony, Mick Jones - balding, clad in black suit and tie - didn't look like a rock'n'roll soldier getting a medal so much as a stoop-shouldered clerk shuffling to the podium to receive his retirement gift for forty-five years' loyal service to the firm. The Clash's meek compliance with their incorporation into the rock pantheon contrasts pleasingly with the intransigence of The Sex Pistols, who threw their invitation to the 2006 ceremony back in the institution's face. (This didn't stop the Hall of Fame inducting them anyway, of course.) The accompanying rude and crudely scrawled note brought a smile to the wrinkled faces of ageing punks everywhere: Next to the Sex Pistols, rock and roll and that hall of fame is a piss stain. Your museum. Urine in wine. We're not coming. We're not your monkeys. If you voted for us, hope you notedyour reasons. Your anonymous as judges but your still music industry people. We're not coming. Your not paying attention. Outside the shit-stream is a real Sex Pistol. On one level, it was a curious gesture of defiance.

The dawning of the Herring Fisheries brought with it the hope of escape from the Highland Clearances, and this story paints a vivid picture of a community fighting against nature and history, and refusing to be crushed.</p><p>Neil Miller Gunn (1891-1973) was a novelist, critic and dramatist, one of the most influential Scottish writers of the first half of the 20th century. He was born in the village of Dunbeath in the county of Caithness, the northernmost county of mainland Scotland. His father was the captain of a herring boat, and Gunn's preoccupation with the sea and fishermen can be traced directly back to his childhood memories of his father's work. He began his working life as a Customs and Excise Officer, and turned to full time writing after he was awarded the 1937 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for <i>Highland</i> <i> River</i> <i>. </i>He continued to write prolifically both as novelist and essayist throughout his life.</p><h2>Stolen Air: Selected Poems of Osip Mandelstam</h2><p>Osip Mandelstam was perhaps the most important Russian poet of the nineteen-hundreds&#x2014;a&nbsp; crucial instigator of the &#x201c;revolution of the word&#x201d; that took place in early twentieth-century St. Petersburg and a political non-conformist who earned the enmity of Stalin and his totalitarian regime. With <em>Stolen Air</em>, Christian Wiman, editor of <em>POETRY</em>, America&#x2019;s oldest and most prestigious magazine of verse, offers a new selection and translation of Mandelstam&#x2019;s poetry&#x2014;from his hard-edged and highly formal early poems to his almost savagely musical later works&#x2014;for a new generation to be moved by, marvel at, and appreciate.<br></p><p><p>A new selection and translation of the work of Osip Mandelstam, perhaps the most important Russian poet of the twentieth century</p><p>Political nonconformist Osip Mandelstam's opposition to Stalin's totalitarian government made him a target of the communist state. The public recitation of his 1933 poem known in English as "The Stalin Epigram" led to his arrest, exile, and eventual imprisonment in a Siberian transit camp, where he died, presumably in 1938. Mandelstam's work&#x2014;much of it written under extreme duress&#x2014;is an extraordinary testament to the enduring power of art in the face of oppression and terror.</p><p><em>Stolen Air</em> spans Mandelstam's entire poetic career, from his early highly formal poems in which he reacted against Russian Symbolism to the poems of anguish and defiant abundance written in exile, when Mandelstam became a truly great poet. Aside from the famous early poems, which have a sharp new vitality in Wiman's versions, <em>Stolen Air</em> includes large selections from <em>The Moscow Notebooks</em> and <em>The Voronezh Notebooks</em>. </p><p>Going beyond previous translators who did not try to reproduce Mandelstam's music, Christian Wiman has captured in English&#x2014;for the first time&#x2014;something of Mandelstam's enticing, turbulent, and utterly heartbreaking sounds.</p><p>Christian Wiman was born and raised in West Texas. He is the editor of <em>Poetry</em> and the author of three collections of poems, <em>Every Riven Thing</em>, <em>Hard Night</em>, and <em>The Long Home</em>, and one collection of prose, <em>Ambition and Survival: Becoming a Poet</em>.</p></p><h2>Someday Angeline (Avon/Camelot Book)</h2><p>Nobody understands why Angeline is so smart.

Angeline doesn&#39;t want to be either a genius or a freak. She just wants the chance to be herself and be happy. But it&#39;s only when she makes friends with a boy the kids call &#34;Goon&#34; and the teacher they call &#34;Mr. Bone&#34; that Angeline gets that chance.</p><p>Lois Sachar, best-selling author of the Wayside School series, knows how to make kids laugh. And there are laughs galore in this popular book, now available again in hardcover. Meet Angeline, who can&#39;t stand being a child genius.When <strong>Louis Sachar</strong> was going to school, his teachers always pronounced his name wrong. Now that he has become a popular author of children&#x2019;s books, teachers all over the country are pronouncing his name wrong.

Although suspiciously regarded by their neighbors as "that hippie couple" because of their well-educated, urban background, Howard and Alice believe they have found a source of emotional strength in the farm, he tending the barn while Alice works as a nurse in the local elementary school.<br><br>But their peaceful life is shattered one day when a neighbor's two-year-old daughter drowns in the Goodwins' pond while under Alice's care. Tormented by the accident, Alice descends even further into darkness when she is accused of sexually abusing of a student at the elementary school. Soon, Alice is arrested, incarcerated, and as good as convicted in the eyes of a suspicious community. As a child, Alice designed her own map of the world to find her bearings. Now, as an adult, she must find her way again, through a maze of lies, doubt and ill will. <br><br>A vivid human drama of guilt and betrayal, <b>A Map of the World</b> chronicles the intricate geographies of the human heart and all its mysterious, uncharted terrain.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a piercing drama about family bonds and a disappearing rural American life.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, December 1999:</b> In <i>A Map of the World</i>, appearance overwhelms reality and communal hysteria threatens common sense. Howard and Alice Goodheart, the couple at the center of Jane Hamilton's 1994 novel, have labored mightily to create a pastoral paradise in a Wisconsin subdivision. Their 400-acre dairy farm is the last in Prairie Center, and they're working flat out to raise their two young girls in a traditionally bucolic manner. Yet paradoxically, they strike their neighbors as unacceptably modern, and have been treated as interlopers since the day of their arrival. Howard, in love with his vocation, chooses not to believe that they've been frozen out. But Alice, flinty and quick to judge, finds things harder. And her job as school nurse doesn't work wonders for her reputation either. Happily, there's one exception to this epidemic of unfriendliness: their closest neighbors. Theresa and Dan, who also have two young daughters, function as a virtual lifeline for the embattled family.<p> But in June 1990, whatever idyll the Goodhearts have worked for comes to a permanent end. On a beautiful morning--marred by her 5-year-old's tantrum but still recuperable--Alice looks forward to taking her children and Theresa's youngest for a swim. Distracted for several minutes, she has no idea that the 2-year-old is no longer in the house: </p><blockquote> Lizzy had run to the pond and splashed in. It had felt good on her hot feet and she kept running and then she was pedaling and pedaling. She tried to grab hold of the water, pawing for the metal bar, a ladder rung, her mother, but there was nothing. She clutched and flailed.... She sank. The trout that Howard had stocked in the pond swam along through the dark water. They noticed Lizzy out of the corner of their eyes. They had inherited the knowledge of that look, and they knew it by heart. </blockquote> This is only the first of Alice's body blows. Next, she's questioned about one of her students, a memorably bad seed. On the verge of collapse, she cries out, "I hurt everybody!"--which will later be construed as a confession. Charged with sexual abuse and unable to come up with $100,000 in bail, she is forced to await trial in jail. <p> Narrated first by Alice, then Howard, and then Alice again, <i>A Map of the World</i> moves from intimate domesticity to courtroom drama with grace and subtlety. Hamilton wrote her book when accusations of abuse in schools and day care were peaking, yet this is not a modish work or an "issue novel" but a lasting creation of several complex lives. At one point, fed up with civil mechanisms, Alice tells her lawyer: "'Let Oprah be the judge.... Let Robbie and me, Mrs. Mackessy, Howard, Theresa, Dan, Mrs. Glevitch--let all of us come before Oprah. Let the studio audience decide. They're nice suburban woman, many of them, dressed for a lark. They have common sense and speak their minds.'" Apparently La Winfrey was listening, since she chose this beautifully observed novel for her book club. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Pen /Hemingway Award-winning novelist Jane Hamilton follows up her first success, <i>The Book Of Ruth</i>, with this spectacularly haunting drama about a rural American family and a disastrous event that forever changes their lives.</p><h2>Sea Glass: A Novel</h2><p><strong>With all the narrative power and emotional immediacy that have made her novels acclaimed international bestsellers, Anita Shreve unfolds a richly engaging tale of marriage, money, and troubled times-the story of a pair of young newlyweds who, setting out to build a life together in a derelict beach house on the Atlantic coast, soon discover how threatening the world outside their front door can be.</strong></p><p>From its opening pages, Anita Shreve's <i>Sea Glass</i> surrounds the reader in the surprisingly rich feeling of the New Hampshire coast in winter. Vividly evoking the life of the coastal community at the beginning of the Great Depression, <i>Sea Glass</i> shifts through the multiple points of view of six principal characters; it's a skillfully created story of braided lives that bounces easily (even inevitably) from character to character. We learn how these lives come together following the stock market crash of 1929 and about the struggles of mill workers on the starkly beautiful New Hampshire coast during the following year. At the novel's center is the story of Honora Beecher, a young newlywed who compulsively collects sea glass along the beach as she collects unexpected friendship in her new beachside community, and Francis, a boy who discovers a father figure in the towering character of McDermott, an Irish mill worker, at a time when he most needs direction. Each character finds unexpected new purpose beyond the struggle to survive during that turbulent year among the dunes. First their lives barely touch, then they intersect, and finally they become inextricably bound. By the powerful and unexpected final scenes of the story, every point of view, every brilliant shard of life depends deeply on all the others. It is a very satisfying read--confidently told and deeply felt--with as many subtle colors and reflections as the sea glass that permeates the narrative. <i>--Paul Ford</i>Anita Shreve is the author of several internationally bestselling novels: The Pilot&#39;s Wife, which was a selection of Oprah&#39;s Book Club; Eden Close; Strange Fits of Passion; Where or When; Resistance; The Weight of Water, which was a finalist for the prestigious Orange Prize; and Fortune&#39;s Rocks.

Her feet are bare; her body is bruised and bloody; U-bolts dangle from her wrists. She has escaped, but not unscathed. The Other Side is the haunting account of a first passionate and then abusive relationship; the events leading to Johnson&#x2019;s kidnapping, rape, and imprisonment; her dramatic escape; and her hard-fought struggle to recover. At once thrilling, terrifying, harrowing, and hopeful, The Other Side offers more than just a true crime record. In language both stark and poetic, Johnson weaves together a richly personal narrative with police and FBI reports, psychological records, and neurological experiments, delivering a raw and unforgettable story of trauma and transformation.</p><p>Lacy M.

Or I do not stumble. I make no noise at all when I open the door with one hand, and hold the two-by-four above my head with the other. Only my feet and legs carry me forward, the rest of my body remains still like a statue. Like a ninja. A cartoon. <br> In the small gravel lot behind the four-plex I find only one vehicle covered by a beige car tarp�the elastic cinched between the bumper and the wheels. I wrestle it off and climb inside, coax my key toward the ignition. The lizard key chain shakes like an actual trapped animal in my hand, ready to shed its tail and flee. Take a breath, I say. You&#x2019;re not dead yet. <br> Inching away from the building, I see the front screen door slapping against the outer wall in the wind. It&#x2019;s too late to get out and close it. The tires spray gravel around the building&#x2019;s unlit side and toward the street, where the street lights strobe on and on and on along the deserted boulevard stretching between the highway and downtown, where the boys down Jaeger shots, the girls down Jaeger shots, all of them dry humping at the bar or on the dance floor or in line for the bathroom. <br> I&#x2019;ll never be one of them again. <br> <br> <br>��� <br> <br>I cross the boulevard by stomping the gas pedal to the floor, fingers ratcheted blue-knuckle tight around the wheel, leaning so far forward my breath fogs the windshield from the inside: proof I&#x2019;m still alive. Or my breath does not make fog. Does not leave my body even. Not one nerve-taut muscle gives way while my headlights illuminate the narrow street, the empty parking stalls, the low beige-brick buildings. <br> <br>When I realize I am not being followed I begin to cry and laugh and scream. Like bubbles. Like a peal. The rearview mirror shows my mascara running. Maybe I should apply a coat of lipstick? A patch of blood spreads where I have bitten my lower lip. The taste of a penny stolen from the kitchen jar. <br> <br>I park the car on the curb in front of the police station and run through the dark with my shoes in my hands, cross the cold tile floor�a checkerboard�to pound on the glass separating me from the two female dispatchers, a steel u-bolt still dangling from my wrist. Under the fluorescent lights, their skin flickers black and blue. They lean back in their chairs, hands folded over their soft round bellies, each pair of legs coming together like a V. Their black sweaters. Their blue polyester pants. The faces turn toward me, the eyebrows raised in disbelief. The clock&#x2019;s arms both point to eleven. They&#x2019;re black. They&#x2019;re blue. <br> <br>��� <br> <br>The stationmaster calls a detective out to meet me in the lobby. Tall and wide-shouldered, with brown hair and eyes, he looks vaguely like my uncle: both have kind faces. But the detective does not smile, does not give me a lung-crushing hug. He leads me into his office with his hand on his gun. Or it is not his office, but an office that is used by him tonight. There is a black rotary telephone with a black spiral cord pushed to the corner of a desk. The wood veneer comes up at the corners, exposing a layer of particleboard underneath. He shuffles in the drawer for a small pad of paper. <br> <br> <i>Tell me everything</i>, he says. Start at the beginning. He does not mean the playground at the preschool with the rainbow bridge. Or the kitten tongue like sandpaper on my cheek. Or the potpourri simmering in the tiny Crock-Pot on the counter next to the jar of pennies in the kitchen. Though any of these could have been a beginning to the story I tell him. I want to see it, the little notepad, but he leaves the room to make some calls. No, I can&#x2019;t call my family. No, not any of my friends. Nothing to do but to look at my feet: suddenly very very absurd. Someone should cover them with shoes and socks. Easier maybe to cut them off and perch them in a tree. <br> <br> <br>He returns to lead me down a dark hallway, where every office is a room with a closed door, through the kitchen, where coffee brews and burns, out a heavy steel door to a parking lot, an unmarked car. A detective&#x2019;s car. He gestures, as if to say, <i>After you.</i> <br> <br>��� <br> <br>While waiting in the unmarked detective&#x2019;s car on an unlit street in the dark shadow of an oak tree I realize that real cops are not at all like movie cops. Real cops are slow and fat. Their bellies, in various states of roundness, hang over their waistbands, cinched tight with braided leather belts. They do not converge on the building with sirens blaring. They do not flash their lights or stand behind the open doors of their squad cars and aim their guns at criminals. These cops, my cops, do not wear uniforms. From the car where I am sitting alone in the shadow of an oak tree, they look like fat men who have happened to meet on the street, walking together around the side of the four-plex, toward the gravel parking lot, where they will find a discarded car tarp, a screen door flapping open, all the lights but one turned out inside. <br> <br>Just inside the door, they will find a dog collar, construction supplies, a soundproofed room. I have told them what to expect. Meanwhile, waiting alone in the car under the dark shadow of an oak tree I start seeing things: no shadow is just a shadow of an oak tree. I press the heels of my palms hard into my eye sockets, sink lower into the seat. My thoughts grow smaller and race in circles. The adrenaline shakes become convulsions become seizures become shock. When the detective returns, he finds me knotted in thirds on the floorboards: hardly like a woman at all. <br> <br> <br>��� <br> <br>At the hospital, the detective leads me through a set of automatic sliding glass doors, not the main ones that lead to the emergency room, but another set, down the way a bit, special for people like me. He leads me down a florescent-lit hallway, directly to an exam room where the overhead lights are turned out. A female officer meets me there, and a social worker, who looks like she might be somebody&#x2019;s grandmother. The officer and the social worker team up with a nurse, and the detective leaves without a word. The officer, the social worker, and the nurse ask me to take off my clothes. They unscrew the u-bolt from my wrist. Officer puts these things into a Ziploc bag named Evidence. <br> Nice to meet you, Evidence. <br> She takes pictures of my wrists and ankles. She speaks in two-syllable sentences: <i>Turn, please. Rape kit. Oh Dear.</i> <br> Sick hobby: it comes with instructions in Spanish, German and Japanese. Glue and little vials of brightly colored paint. The social worker wants to hold my hand. No thank you, ma&#x2019;am. She is, after all, not my grandmother. Her skin is loose and clammy. She asks what kind of poetry I write as Evidence rips out fingerfuls of my pubic hair, spreads my legs and digs inside me with a long, stiff Q-tip. Another Q-tip in my mouth for saliva. She scrapes under my fingernails with a wooden skewer and puts the scum in a plastic vial. <br> The social worker invites me to stay at her house. Or it is not her house, exactly, but a half-house for half-women like me. <br> After the exam, the social worker gives me a green sweat suit in a brown paper bag. I&#x2019;m supposed to dress in the bathroom. But the clothes are entirely too large: a too-large hunter green sweatshirt, a pair of too-large hunter green sweatpants, a pair of too-large beige underwear. Like my mother wears. <br> Officer doesn&#x2019;t acknowledge that I look ridiculous emerging from the bathroom. Officer doesn&#x2019;t acknowledge me at all. I know to follow her out the door, to the parking lot, her squad car. I know to hang my head. It&#x2019;s the price for a ticket to the station. <br> Morning. <br> The phone call wakes my parents out of bed. Mom answers; her voice is thick, confused. She says nothing for a long time. In the background, Dad gets dressed. Yesterday&#x2019;s change jingles in his pockets. His voice buckles: <i>Say we&#x2019;re on the way.</i> <br> <br> <br>��� <br> <br>The detective follows me to my new apartment in the unmarked car. He offers to come inside, to stand guard at the door, but I don&#x2019;t want him seeing that I have no furniture, no food in the fridge, nothing in the pantry, or the linen closet, or on the walls. I ask him to wait outside. I call my boss at the literary magazine where I am an intern and leave a message on her office voicemail: Hi there. I was kidnapped and raped last night. I won&#x2019;t be coming in today. I call My Good Friend&#x2019;s cellphone. I call My Older Sister&#x2019;s cellphone. <br> <br>While I&#x2019;m in the shower, the apartment phone rings and callers leave messages on the machine: My Good Friend will stay with her boyfriend; she&#x2019;s delaying her move-in date. Of course she hates to do this, but she&#x2019;s just too scared to live here, with me, right now. You should find somewhere to go, she says. My Handsome Friend&#x2019;s message says he heard the news from My Good Friend. He&#x2019;s leaving town and doesn&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s safe to tell me where to find him. The message My Older Sister leaves says she wants me to come stay at her place, which sounds better than sleeping alone in this apartment on the floor. <br> I pry back the curtains and see my parents standing in the parking lot talking to the detective. My father shakes the detective&#x2019;s outstretched hand. My mother covers her chest with her arms, one hand over her mouth, a large beige purse hanging from her shoulder. She&#x2019;s brought me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and a snack-size bag of Cool Ranch Doritos. I&#x2019;m not hungry, but the thought of wasting her effort makes my stomach turn and turn. <br> I nibble the chips in the backseat of their car while they take me to buy a cellphone. They want to do something, to take action.

Now his acclaimed new collection, <i>The Toughest Indian in the World,</i> which received universal praise in hardcover, is available in paperback. In these stories, we meet the kind of American Indians we rarely see in literature -- the kind who pay their bills, hold down jobs, fall in and out of love. A Spokane Indian journalist transplanted from the reservation to the city picks up a hitchhiker, a Lummi boxer looking to take on the toughest Indian in the world. A Spokane son waits for his diabetic father to come home from the hospital, tossing out the Hershey Kisses the father has hidden all over the house. An estranged interracial couple, separated in the midst of a traffic accident, rediscover their love for each other. A white drifter holds up an International House of Pancakes, demanding a dollar per customer and someone to love, and emerges with $42 and an overweight Indian he dubs Salmon Boy. Sherman Alexie's voice is one of remarkable passion, and these stories are love stories -- between parents and children, white people and Indians, movie stars and ordinary people. Witty, tender, and fierce, <i>The Toughest Indian in the World</i> is a virtuoso performance by one of the country's finest writers.</p><p>Call Sherman Alexie any number of things--novelist, poet, filmmaker, thorn in the side of white liberalism--just don't call him "universal." Aside from his well-documented distaste for the word, its fuzziness misses the point. <i>The Toughest Indian in the World</i>, Alexie's second collection, succeeds as brilliantly as it does because of its particularity. These aren't stories about the Indian Condition; they're stories about Indians--urban and reservation, street fighters and yuppies, husbands and wives. "She understood that white people were eccentric and complicated and she only wanted to be understood as eccentric and complicated as well," thinks the Coeur d'Alene narrator of "Assimilation," who's married (unhappily) to a white man. And yet the issue of race has taken up permanent residence inside her house: the marriage survives, but it's love that's the most thorough assimilation of all. <p> Like <i>The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven</i>, much of <i>The Toughest Indian in the World</i> combines deft psychological realism with the kind of narrative logic more commonly found in dreams. In "South by Southwest," a white drifter finds love on a "nonviolent killing spree" with an overweight Indian he calls Salmon Boy; in "Dear John Wayne," the cowboy actor falls in love with a young Spokane woman and proves himself a charmingly feminist hero. ("Oh, sons, you're just engaging in some harmless gender play," he tells his boys when he finds them trying on lipstick.) But for every bear hibernating on top of the Catholic church, there's also a GAP-wearing, Toyota-driving urban Indian on a quest for his roots. In both realist and surrealist modes, Alexie writes incantatory prose--as well as the kind of dialogue that makes even secondary characters leap into sudden focus: "'What?' asked Wonder Horse, as simple a question as could possibly be tendered, though he made it sound as if he'd asked <i>Where's the tumor?</i>"</p><p> Alexie is sometimes guilty of painting his white characters with too broad a brush. (Is any anthropologist truly as obtuse as the one in "Dear John Wayne"? Could any reader really <i>want</i> Mary Lynn, the narrator of "Assimilation," to stay with her boorish white husband?) Yet his kind of firebrand politics still has the power to shock. A harrowing fable about whites kidnapping Indians for the medical properties of their blood, "The Sin Eaters" could be dismissed as paranoid if it weren't so hauntingly written: </p><blockquote> On that morning, the sun rose and bloomed like blood in a glass syringe. The entire Spokane Indian Reservation and all of its people and places were clean and scrubbed. The Spokane River rose up from its bed like a man who had been healed and joyously wept all the way down to its confluence with the Columbia River. There was water everywhere: a thousand streams interrupted by makeshift waterfalls; small ponds hidden beneath a mask of thick fronds and anonymous blossoms; blankets of dew draped over the shoulders of isolated knolls. An entire civilization of insects lived in the mud puddle formed by one truck tire and a recent rain storm. The blades of grass, the narrow pine needles, and the stalks of roadside wheat were as sharp and bright as surgical tools. </blockquote> It's a hard story to read, and that's only right. <i>The Toughest Indian in the World</i> offers so many pleasures, who could deny it the power to disturb us as well? Funny, dreamlike, heartbreaking, angry--these are stories that could have been written by no one but Sherman Alexie. <i>--Mary Park</i>Sherman Alexie has been acclaimed by Time as "one of the better new novelists, Indian or otherwise," and his books have been compared to those of Richard Wright and James Baldwin in their immense lyric power and revolutionary spirit. Now, Sherman Alexie gives us his first new collection since the best-selling The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven. <p>In these stories, we meet the kinds of American Indians we rarely see in literature--the upper and middle class, the professionals and white-collar workers, the bureaucrats and poets, falling in and out of love and wondering if they will make their way home. A Spokane Indian journalist transplanted from the reservation to the city picks up a hitchhiker, a Lummi boxer looking to take on the toughest Indian in the world. A Spokane son waits for his diabetic father to return from the hospital, listening to his father�s friends argue over Jesus' carpentry skills as they build a wheelchair ramp. An estranged interracial couple, separated in the midst of a traffic accident, rediscover their love for each other. A white drifter holds up an International House of Pancakes, demanding a dollar per customer and someone to love, and emerges with forty-two dollars and an overweight Indian he dubs Salmon Boy. Sherman Alexie's is a voice of remarkable passion, and these stories are love stories--between parents and children, white people and Indians, movie stars and ordinary people. Witty, tender, and fierce, The Toughest Indian in the World is a virtuoso performance by one of the country's finest writers. </p><p>"Humorous, disturbing, formally inventive and heartwarming, Alexie's stories continually surprise, revealing him again and again as a master of his craft."--Publishers Weekly (starred review) </p><p>"Make no mistake: Alexie's talent is immense and genuine.... On this big Indian reservation we call 'the United States,' Sherman Alexie is one of the best writers we have."--Leslie Marmon Silko, The Nation </p><p>"The world's first fast-talking, wisecracking, mediagenic American Indian superstar.... There is an anger in Sherman Alexie's work that hasn't been seen since James Baldwin...his characters carry the uneasy burden of racism with a resigned form of black humor."--Bruce Barcott, Men's Journal </p><p>"Hard-edged and urban, distinctly individual.... The characters in Mr. Alexie's work are not the usual kind of Indians.... They are not tragic victims or noble savages...they listen to Jimi Hendrix and Hank Williams; they dream of being basketball stars.... And unlike most Indians in fiction, they are sometimes funny."--Dinitia Smith, The New York Times </p><p>Sherman Alexie is a Spokane/Coeur d'Alene Indian. He is the author of the novels Reservation Blues and Indian Killer, and he wrote the award-winning screenplay for Smoke Signals, a film based on his short-story collection The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.</p></p><h2>Eight Years to the Moon: The History of the Apollo Missions</h2><p><b>A Behind-the-Scenes Look At NASA's incredible Journey to the Moon</b><b></b><br> <b>"Atkinson's book is one of the best books published on Apollo"</b> --<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science magazine &nbsp; <b>"If you read only one book on the subject, it should be "Eight Years to the Moon"</b> --&nbsp; St. Paul Pioneer Press <b></b><br>Space journalist and insider Nancy Atkinson weaves together the riveting story of NASA's mission to complete "the greatest adventure on which humankind ever embarked."<br><br>This incredible account is a keepsake celebrating some of the most important and dramatic events in modern history.

Enormous growth, raging crime, and tumultuous politics have also made it one of the most feared and misunderstood. Yet in the past decade, the city has become a hot spot for international business, fashion, and art, and a magnet for thrill-seeking expats from around the world. <br><br>In 2002, Daniel Hernandez traveled to Mexico City, searching for his cultural roots. He encountered a city both chaotic and intoxicating, both underdeveloped and hypermodern. In 2007, after quitting a job, he moved back. With vivid, intimate storytelling, Hernandez visits slums populated by ex-punks; glittering, drug-fueled fashion parties; and pseudo-native rituals catering to new-age Mexicans. He takes readers into the world of youth subcultures, in a city where punk and emo stand for a whole way of life&#x2014;and sometimes lead to rumbles on the streets. <br><br>Surrounded by volcanoes, earthquake-prone, and shrouded in smog, the city that Hernandez lovingly chronicles is a place of astounding manifestations of danger, desire, humor, and beauty, a surreal landscape of &#x201c;cosmic violence.&#x201d; For those who care about one of the most electrifying cities on the planet, &#x201c;<i>Down &amp; Delirious in Mexico City </i>is essential reading&#x201d; (David Lida, author of <i>First Stop in the New World</i>).</p><p><b>Daniel Hernandez</b> is a freelance journalist in Mexico City and a contributor at the Mexico City bureau of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.

Merely landing at or departing from Benito Ju�rez International Airport belies the city&#x2019;s physical contours, the ranges of mountains that ring its basin. Flying in or out conceals what you&#x2019;re really dealing with. You must experience Mexico City&#x2019;s hugeness as a journey of distance, inch by inch, mile by mile, traffic allowing. On a late afternoon, nearing sunset, during the smoggiest season of the year, winter, your bus or car is climbing the mountains to the east. The road curves and pitches. You can feel the air outside get colder and colder. The mountains in every direction are suddenly covered in brilliant green trees. To the west the sun disappears behind a dark cloud hanging over the enormous valley. It is not a rain cloud. It is a blanket of pollution permanently fixed over the city. A nasty thick black cloud, so dark in the shrinking light of dusk that you cannot see anything underneath it. The only way you can tell the city exists below is because from miles away you can still feel its hum. It&#x2019;s almost impossible to believe, like a vision of some futuristic hell.<br><br><i>People live there?</i><br><br>I survive my first smoggy winter in Mexico City by applying a gee-whiz sort of awe to it. I hack up alien-looking green phlegm in the mornings for weeks at a time, but I can&#x2019;t really comprehend just how toxic the city gets around Christmas and the New Year. In my second winter, I have moved to the Centro, to a second-floor apartment facing a street choked constantly in the daytime with traffic. It is a Saturday in late January when I wake up with a violent cough. Throughout the day the air feels as if it is sagging on my back. By Sunday I have a nagging headache. It is cold at night, but it still feels hot out somehow. Something on the skin, a stickiness, a barely perceptible unnatural film.<br><br>The news bears out my suspicions. It is a thermal inversion, an unkind weather phenomenon that afflicts places dense with people and pollutants. In the mountain bowl of Mexico City, a thermal inversion can be acute and dangerous when it strikes during the dry season. Warm air that gathers in daylight is trapped on the valley floor by cold air that moves in at night. The warm air mixes with what&#x2019;s already there, all the pollutants of everyday urban activity. It has been an especially polluted weekend in the capital. Toxicity levels spike to a point that prompts the D.F. government to activate its environmental contingency plan, calling for limited outdoor activity, temporary restrictions on the manufacturing sector, and circulation restrictions on certain vehicles such as older models and cars from neighboring states. I scribble in a journal, <i>My throat feels like a cat pissed in it and my head feels like it&#x2019;s spent four hours listening to the same Daddy Yankee song on full volume, on loop.</i><br><br>A few merciful breezes visit the city. By that afternoon, the government lifts the contingency alert. All activity returns to normal, but the following day the air still feels outrageously toxic. This makes me a little nervous. Mexico City&#x2019;s current official slogan is Capital in Movement, so by necessity we can have it no other way. A Mexico City with fewer cars and trucks on the streets, with less commercial and manufacturing activity, less <i>movimiento,</i> is a Mexico City that loses money by the hour. Can&#x2019;t have that. So eyes are puffy and dry, coughs are chronic, and just a few flights of stairs leave you winded. That pinched sensation of nastiness lingers on the skin. In the schools, recess is held indoors. TV Azteca reports that scores of city children show up at doctors&#x2019; offices complaining of bronchitis. They say the chief pollutant that weekend is ozone. But . . . whatever. No one really knows what to call the cocktail we breathe in Mexico City. It is a mixture of ozone with nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons&#x2014;inhaled and exhaled in a continuous cycle by some 20 million people, day in and day out. What can you call that, really?<br><br>In the dryness of winter, the form and effects of the pollution are strongest. But winter or not, it is always there, hanging invisibly over your head, even when the summer rains come and clear away the sitting atmosphere for a few hours a day. At seventy-three hundred feet, the valley&#x2019;s altitude, the air pressure is dramatically lower than on coastlines, which heightens the pollution&#x2019;s least favorable effects on the human body. People get sick chronically. The Mexico City smog affects your entire person, body and mind. Knowing you are inhaling an atmosphere once famously described as being equivalent to a habit of daily chain-smoking (which plenty of <i>capitalinos</i> do anyway) is enough to make you question your and your neighbor&#x2019;s sanity.<br><br>On the worst days, the cocky cigarette-sucking of so many proud Mexico City natives grows exponentially. What else can you do but gather friends and hunker inside, to booze up, suck in the nicotine&#x2014;&#x201c;Might as well&#x201d;&#x2014;and to think fondly of the days before the birth of the world&#x2019;s first Smog City, a capital internationally known for being caked in pollution. It was just the way the story went, when Mexico shifted from a largely rural society of communal farmland and the slow lifestyle of the hacienda to a rapidly urbanizing one of crowded highways and factories coughing purple fumes. Starting in the late 1950s, people came to the big city in the valley from the provinces, near and far. They kept coming, and kept coming. Urban immigrants came looking for work because in Mexico City, they were told, it did not matter how poor or marginalized you were, you could find a hustle and provide for yourself. The city was irresistible. Slums sprang up around the outskirts, unplanned and all but ignored. The same phenomenon would eventually change cities in East Asia, in other parts of North and South America, and in Africa and Europe, but for much of the twentieth century it did not happen at the scale and velocity anywhere else that it happened in high central Mexico. A lack of proper infrastructure in an accelerating grid of humans and industry soon bred the first poisonous clouds over Mexico City, never to leave. Environmental misery followed.<br><br>Planners and regulators would dub it uncontainable, a city whose apparent destiny of failure was rooted in its ability to attract endless streams of new residents. The city grew, by the thousands a day, by some accounts, and its situation worsened. During a memorably bad period of thermal inversion in 1991, when the city&#x2019;s smog was at what is now considered its historical peak, the <i>New York Times</i> quoted a local expert: &#x201c;If the meteorological conditions remain the same, then we could have a thermal inversion that could equal the killing smog of London in the winter of 1950&#x2013;51.&#x201d;<br><br>There is no such panic today, even on bad days. The city has grown accustomed to itself. In the bowl, no one seems to notice the poison. The sky above you is some shade of blue, right? Why complain? The locals say it is normal. They don&#x2019;t seem to mind. They look at you with pity. During this extra-smoggy weekend in January, residents in my building make an effort to go outside as little as possible. We open beers and talk. In the darkened interior of an apartment upstairs, my neighbor Ponce, a cartoonist and illustrator born and raised in the capital, calmly explains the air of normalcy while smoking a few singles. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re mutants,&#x201d; Ponce says.<br><br>I down my can of beer, ask for an extra smoke, and retreat back to my apartment. What Ponce says makes my eyes pop in recognition. To be raised in Mexico City, or to willingly assimilate yourself to it, is to relinquish control over your natural state. The environment <i>physically alters you.</i> Because we&#x2019;ve physically altered it. Ponce has uttered a cosmic truth. The Mexico City mutation is real.<br><br>Smog levels have steadily been dropping in Mexico City in recent years, but it remains above us, operating more than anything else as a totem. It symbolizes our species&#x2019; irrevocable dominance over the planet. In places like the Valley of Mexico, where industry, urbanization, density, and the centuries have made the earth our violated dominion, the consequences of this reality haunt us. It is, as Ponce says, unnatural. It leads us into conflict with the elements, with fellow men, and with the gods.<br><br>The planet seeks payback in Mexico City. Earthquakes remain a spectral threat. The massive 8.1-magnitude temblor that swept the city on September 19, 1985, is a wailing ghost that still rings far in the back of people&#x2019;s minds. An estimated ten thousand people died, but no one knows for sure. The city was brought to its knees. Off in the distance, usually invisible behind the smog, the Popocat�petl and Iztacc�huatl volcanoes pose a subdued terrestrial menace. They&#x2019;re dormant, but&#x2014;<i>could they wake up one morning?</i> There are the freakish rains and thunderstorms, bringing pounding blasts of wind. Neighborhoods flood, drowning kids and old ladies. Hills or asphalt streets give way. Trees snap and crush small cars. The land and sky remind us every day that they remain older and more powerful than anything we can bring to them.<br><br>Among people, the threatening qualities of the environment sometime ignite a primal urge&#x2014;the urge to kill. Mexico City is by no means the most dangerous metropolis on earth. Cities such as Washington, D.C., for example, have higher homicide rates. But in the Aztec megacity death and murder acquire a disquieting intimacy with everyday life. In page after page, the red-note papers are filled with practically gleeful reports on the cruelest deaths, often accompanied by graphic photographs. A French scientist who is held up on a busy road and shot in the face after being followed from the airport, dying days later. An Italian man who is shot dead after refusing to cooperate with thieves on a bus. The transgendered sex worker in Ecatepec whose head is rammed to mush by a huge cinder block at the hands of a client. Bodies are found beheaded, burned in tanks of gasoline, mutilated, or beaten to death, blow by blow. There are robberies gone bad, executions carried out in shadowy alleys, and crimes of violent passion. In the age of narco warfare and the growing cult of the Santa Muerte&#x2014;the unofficial saint of &#x201c;holy death&#x201d;&#x2014;the killings numb us. News of a death to start off the day and news of a death before going to bed at night. Killings presented as common and as in-your-face as the traffic and smog.<br><br>Every day the papers tell us how the urban claims its victims. There are drownings, freak car accidents, vehicles turning over, indoor carbon monoxide poisonings, and horrible falls. The claiming of victims is indiscriminate. A wealthy person dies just as terribly as a poor one, and only the opulence or humility of their gravestones will mark their differences during life. Living in Mexico City becomes a long risky slog through an infinitely treacherous landscape. Some people are keenly aware of it, and it can drive them mad.<br><br>William S. Burroughs once described Mexico City as &#x201c;sinister and gloomy and chaotic, with the special chaos of a dream.&#x201d; That was in the late 1940s, when D.F. had a small fraction of the population it does now and the mountains and volcanoes that ring the basin were crisply visible on the horizon. &#x201c;No Mexican really knew any other Mexican,&#x201d; Burroughs wrote, some fifty years after the experience, &#x201c;and when a Mexican killed someone (which happened often), it was usually his best friend. . . . Mexico was basically an Oriental culture that reflected two thousand years of disease and poverty and degradation and stupidity and slavery and brutality and psychic and physical terrorism.&#x201d;<br><br>Reading this, I instinctively respond with disgust of my own, tallying up all the offensive phrases. Then I think about it again. I think about all the writers whose attempts I&#x2019;ve seen to sum up the soul of Mexico in a single argumentative statement, from the romantic or the nationalistic, to the postmodern or celebratory. Few are as raw, and as honest. Burroughs looked in the city&#x2019;s heart and it looked alien, violent, and sinister to him, like a pathogen. His experience illustrates the city&#x2019;s ability to swallow and permanently transform an individual. This was where Burroughs perfected his dark bohemian lifestyle&#x2014;drug use, alcohol abuse, chasing young American guys for sex, fixing up his heroin on Dolores Street in Centro, just around the corner from where I sit. In Mexico City, Burroughs forged his twisted relationship with death. It is said Burroughs never lived or wrote the same again.<br><br>The problem that Burroughs and so many others have identified, and which is not going away anytime soon, is a sustained struggle over equilibrium, a lost balance with the elements and with history. The Aztecs who witnessed the original encounter with the Europeans must have felt the coming chaos. Their entire system of things, they believed, was at the mercy of their gods, the custodians of the elements. The earth they knew demanded sustenance. To them, the citadel of temples at the center of their city&#x2014;Tenochtitlan&#x2014;was the &#x201c;belly button of the moon.&#x201d; As it was the center of the universe, according to their spiritual logic, all their gods were present. The god of war, god of fire, the god of earth, the sun god, the moon goddess. They had to be thanked somehow. So the Aztecs built their empire on sacrificial credit, submitted untold amounts of human souls in ritual sacrifice to ensure the rising of the sun, the rains, and their way of life.<br><br>They fed the land with blood. Children and infants were sacrificed to Tlaloc, who required the tears of the young to wash over the earth with rain. Slaves, virgins, and prisoners of war were slaughtered to dedicate new temples and to ring in the new year. Their severed heads were placed on <i>tzompantli</i> racks on the city&#x2019;s central plaza for all to see.<br><br>When they arrived, the Spanish regarded these practices as barbaric. But in conquering Mexico, they replaced the system of ritual sacrifice with something arguably bloodier and more brutal. The Conquest was a spectacularly violent encounter, a &#x201c;foundational holocaust.&#x201d; Once subdued, the surviving Indians watched their cities and temples be dismantled. Their gods were replaced by images of Jesus Christ, his saints, and the new mother, sweet Guadalupe. In the early years of the consolidation of New Spain, indigenous survivors succumbed to disease in overwhelming numbers, killing off entire lineages and turning thriving urban settlements into ghost towns. Their world had been upended. Cities disappeared, their ruins willowing into the brush, forgotten. The force of the Conquest was so fierce, many Indians, one troubled priest wrote in the late sixteenth century, became &#x201c;apathetic.&#x201d; Many refused medicine when they became sick, the priest wrote, choosing instead to &#x201c;die like brutes.&#x201d;<br><br>I can&#x2019;t imagine the agony, unable to render to their gods&#x2014;Tonantz�n or Tlaloc or Huitzilopochtli&#x2014;as they had done since the dawn of their world. But history marched on. In the ensuing generations, Mexicans of all castes intermixed beyond order and recognition, spawning the new, idealized mestizo civilization. With the boost from the Virgen de Guadalupe, everyone became a Roman Catholic. Mexicans eventually let go of the Aztec gods, but that didn&#x2019;t mean the deities just disappeared into the cosmos. In Mexico City it is regarded as a sad spiritual irony that the Metropolitan Cathedral&#x2014;built on pre-Hispanic holy land&#x2014;is sinking into the earth.<br><br>The spiritual imbalance heightens the sense that Mexico City is a geography ...</p><h2>Epic Cosplay Costumes: A Step-by-Step Guide to Making and Sewing Your Own Costume Designs</h2><p><b>The Ultimate Guide to Cosplay, Costumes and Conventions!</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Presented in a kitschy, comic-book style, <i>Epic Cosplay Costumes</i> combines fantabulous illustrations with all the how-to information you need for creating your own cosplay designs.

The first Americans who looked out over California saw arid grasslands and chaparral, and over the course of generations, they remade those landscapes according to the aesthetic values and economic interests of settlers, urban planners, and boosters. In the San Fernando Valley, entrepreneurs amassed fortunes from vast citrus groves; in the Bay Area, gum trees planted to beautify neighborhoods fed wildfires; and across the state, the palm came to stand for the ease and luxury of the rapidly expanding suburbs. Meanwhile, thousands of native redwoods and sequoias were logged to satisfy the insatiable urbanizing impulse. Revealing differing visions of what California should and could be, this natural and unnatural history unravels the network of forces that shape our most fundamental sense of place.</p><p>Jared Farmer is a professor of history at Stony Brook University who specializes in the environmental history of the American West. He is the author of two previous books: <i>Glen Canyon Dammed: Inventing Lake Powell and the Canyon Country</i> (University of Arizona Press, 1999) and <i>On Zion's Mount: Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape</i> (Harvard University Press, 2008).

His possessiveness made her strangely giddy. As far as he was concerned, she was his, and no one was going to take her away from him.</p><p>Max stared at Etienne. His voice was soft, but it contained a note that chilled Lysette's blood.

She&#x2019;s a RITA award-winning author of both historical romance and contemporary women&#x2019;s fiction. She lives in Washington State with her husband Gregory and their two children.</p>Kleypas has given Only in Your Arms, her first title for Avon, a makeover, and the resulting book boasts a tighter plot and richer characterizations. Set in New Orleans in the early 19th century, this atmospheric tale portrays the romance between Lysette Kersaint, a strong-willed Creole who is on the run from her abusive stepfather and an arranged marriage to a man she loathes, and Maximilien Vallerand, a notorious rake and widower who is rumored to have strangled his adulterous wife. Lysette finds protection in Max's home, but she soon learns that he plans to use her as a pawn to exact revenge against her intended, Etienne Sagesse, his sworn enemy. The tension between the two quickly heats up, but before they can find happiness together, they must settle the mysteries of Max's past. The romance between Max and Lysette is compelling, but what really sets this book apart is Kleypass ability to make the period come alive. With the ease of a skilled seamstress, Kleypas weaves in dozens of details, touching on everything from the political tensions between Mexico and the American territories to the cultural differences between Creoles and Americans. Kleypas doesn't shy away from developing her characters either. Max emerges as a tortured but admirable hero, and even secondary figures like Maxs mother and brothers take on a life of their own.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Lives of Lucian Freud: The Restless Years: 1922-1968</h2><p><b>The first biography of the epic life of one of the most important, enigmatic and private artists of the 20th century. Drawn from almost 40 years of conversations with the artist, letters and papers, it is a major work written by a well-known British art critic.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Lucian Freud (1922-2011) is one of the most influential figurative painters of the 20th century. His paintings are in every major museum and many private collections here and abroad. William Feaver's daily calls from 1973 until Freud died in 2011, as well as interviews with family and friends were crucial sources for this book.Freud had ferocious energy, worked day and night but his circle was broad including not just other well-known artists but writers, bluebloods, royals in England and Europe, drag queens, fashion models gamblers, bookies and gangsters like the Kray twins. Fierce, rebellious, charismatic, extremely guarded about his life, he was witty, mischievous and a womanizer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brilliantly researched and well written book begins with the Freuds' life in Berlin, the rise of Hitler and the family's escape to London in 1933 when Lucian was 10. Sigmund Freud was his grandfather and Ernst, his father was an architect. In London in his twenties, his first solo show was in 1944 at the Lefevre Gallery. Around this time, Stephen Spender introduced him to Virginia Woolf, at night he was taking Pauline Tennant to the Gargoyle Club, owned by her father and frequented by Dylan Thomas; he was also meeting Sonia Orwell, Cecil Beaton, Auden, Patrick Leigh-Fermor and the Aly Khan, and his muse was a married femme fatale, 13 years older, Lorna Wishart. But it was Francis Bacon who would become his most important influence and the painters Frank Auerbach and David Hockney, close friends.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Freud's first trip to Paris in 1946 he met the artists Picasso, Giacometti, Andre Breton, Alexander Calder and Balthus. Next was a trip to Greece then trips to the south of France with the Graham Sutherlands. More shows followed in London and Paris and Kenneth Clark tried to buy a painting in 1947 for the Tate, Alfred Barr did buy one for MoMa in 1948, the year Freud married his first wife Kitty Garman Epstein, the daughter of the famous sculptor, Jacob Epstein. In 1952 he eloped with Lady Caroline Blackwood to Paris where they married in 1953; there were two girls from the first marriage but he had twelve other children from his many liasons.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extremely intimate, lively and rich portrait of the artist, full of gossip and stories recounted by Freud to Feaver about people, encounters, and work. Freud's art was his life&#x2014;"my work is purely autobiographical"&#x2014;and he usually painted only family, friends, lovers, children, though there were exceptions like the famous small portrait of the Queen. With his later portraits, the subjects were often nude, names were never given and sittings could take up to 16 months, each session lasting five hours but subjects were rarely bored as Freud was a great raconteur and mimic. This book is a major achievement, a tour de force that reveals the details of the life and innermost thoughts of the greatest portrait painter of our time. Volume I has 41 black and white integrated images, and 2 eight-page color inserts.</p><p>WILLIAM FEAVER is an art critic, and curator.

Nobody was there taking notes when it happened. And how could anyone know what was in the mind of God when He made the first man and woman? No one could know these things unless God Himself took the initiative to tell somebody. And that is precisely what He did. We can reasonably assume that God spoke with Adam and Eve about His joy in creating the universe and that they passed these stories on to their children. But stories that are handed down from generation to generation in this way become distorted, and so it is important to realize that God revealed these things more directly. Later in our journey, we will meet with Moses. God appeared to him visibly and spoke to him audibly (Num. 12:8). This unique privilege of speaking with God face to face enabled Moses to write what God gave him to say in the first five books of the Bible.</p><h2>Thirteen Pieces of the Jigsaw: Solving Political, Cultural and Spiritual Riddles, Past and Present</h2><p>In 2013, James Perloff published his landmark primer on the New World Order <i>Truth Is a Lonely Warrior</i>.

Shake off your jacket, brush the snow off your goggles and you'll find yourself at Whitewater Winter Resourt, snuggled within the craggy peaks of the Selkirk Moutnain Range, some 21 km south of Nelson, British Columbia. Nelson is known throughout the skiing world for its artistic flair, heritage buildings and its passion for caffeine and powder snow. Come to Nelson for the coffee; stay for the powder... oh, and bring a snow blower. </p><p> With a base elevation of 5400 feet and a summit elevation of 6700 feet, Whitewater receives an average annual snowfall of 40-50 feet of dry Kootenay powder. Ymir peak, at an elevation of 8000 feet provides a spectacular focal point to Whitewater basin, soaring above the clouds to imbue skiers with its majestic spirit. Aside from over 700 acres of incredible tree, glade and unparalleled powder skiing, Whitewater also offers its guests delicious meals that have long been the envy of ski resorts across North America. </p><p> After a mind-blowing powder run through Catch Basin, Terra Ratta, Sproulers, many a snow-encrusted skier has stumbled into the lodge and ploughed into a piece of heaven like a Ymir Curry Bowl or a Whiskey Smoked Salmon Chowder from Whitewater's extensive gourmet menu at the Fresh Tracks Caf�. "For the love of Cod," they moan in ecstasy, "You must give me the recipe." </p><p> Alas, until now the gourmet recipes made famous at Whitewater were as unattainable as a snowflake in July. So guarded were some of the ingredients that employees had to swear an oath of secrecy before being allowed in or out of the kitchen. Legend has it that more than one former kitchen worker who could not keep the faith lies beneath the floorboards of "Coal Oil Johnny's". </p><p> After much consternation, the veil has been lifted and the general public now has the opportunity to rustle up a touch of Whitewater heaven in the privacy of their own kitchens. With the help of this guidebook, you can now enjoy the magic of the Whitewater menu twelve months a year. To those of you who have begged for years for the ingredients to the Whitewater Burger Sauce, we sag, "stop phoning". To those of you who love a little magic in your Monday, who sleep with your skis from September to April, who appreciate the difference between coriander and cilantro, we say, "Whitewater cooks, Bon Appetit". </p><p><b> WHITEWATER HISTORY </b></p><p> Whitewater Ski Area was discovered when two local Nelson businessmen, exploring backcountry mountain roads on motorcycles, pulled over for a break and spotted what appeared to be a natural ski bowl tucked into the hidden peaks of the Selkirk Range. </p><p> In 1969 the two men, together with the Silver King Ski Club, initiated the development of the Whitewater basin, at the foot of Ymir peak. The project was supported and financed by the club, the province, and the good people of Nelson, who volunteered almost 9,000 hours of work over five years (close to what the current owners, Mike and Shelley Adams, log each ski season). </p><p> Over the next six gears, the ski facilities were installed. The famous Whitewater lodge was designed by a local architect and completed in October, 1974. The following year, two Riblet chairs (Riblet Lifts Co. originated in Nelson) were installed. </p><p> In 1986, a small herd of local skiing enthusiasts pooled their meagre resources to purchase the ski area from the Ski Society. Their goals were to offer a safe and enjoyable ski experience at an affordable price while continuing to improve and expand the ski area. </p><p> In 1992 Whitewater purchased the infamous "Olive Chair" from Whistler. The following year the T-bar was removed, and Whitewater's new Silver King Chair was installed. A downtown Nelson office was opened in September of 1993 to better serve Whitewater's growing powder-hound population. </p><p> During the summer of 1997 the last of the Riblet lifts, the Hummingbird Chair, was removed and the Hummer Handle Tow was installed to provide lift serviced beginner terrain [the "bunny hill"). </p><p> The same year, Shelleg and Mike Adams won the right to purchase the ski area from the previous owners in a now legendary game of high stakes Scrabble. Shelleg and Mike continue to offer a philosophy of providing a safe and enjoyable ski experience at an affordable price, with "all you can eat" powder. </p><p> An additional 80 acres of skiable glades were added to Whitewater in 2003 when a major boundary expansion took place. With the launch of a twenty-year master expansion plan in 2003, the future of the ski area was ensured. </p><p> Whitewater has been recognized in national and international magazines for the quaintness of its setting, the quantity of its powder and the quality of its food. </p><p> Taste the mountain.

Because <i>someone</i> with that name has been touring Israel, promoting a bizarre reverse exodus of the Jews. Roth is intent on stopping him, even if that means impersonating his own impersonator. <br><br>With excruciating suspense, unfettered philosophical speculation, and a cast of characters that includes Israeli intelligence agents, Palestinian exiles, an accused war criminal, and an enticing charter member of an organization called Anti-Semites Anonymous, <b>Operation Shylock</b> barrels across the frontier between fact and fiction, seriousness and high comedy, history and nightmare.</p><p>Philip Roth's very literary novels, most famously <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i>, have always had the feel of confessional autobiography. <i>Operation Shylock</i> boasts not only a character named Philip Roth, a Jewish-American novelist, but an impostor who is claiming to be him. Roth's impostor causes a furor in Israel by advocating "Diasporism," the polar opposite of Zionism, encouraging Israelis to return home to eastern Europe. In Israel the real Roth attends the trial of a former Nazi, and also observes at a West Bank military court dealing harshly with young Palestinians. Through stark counterpoint between distorted doubles, along with his trademark bawdy humor, Roth comically explores the tensions of his identity as a writer, as a Jew, and as a human being. <i>Operation Shylock</i> won the PEN/Faulkner Award for 1994."One of Roth's grand inventions.... [He is] a comic genius...a living master." &#x2014;Harold Bloom, <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"The uncontested master of comic irony." &#x2014;<i>Time</i> magazine<br><br>"A devilish book, nervously exuding a kind of delirious brilliance like sweat at every pore, and madly comic." &#x2014;Alfred Kazin<br><br>"A brilliant novel of ideas...Roth has gone farther into his own genius than he ever has before." &#x2014;Ted Solotaroff, <i>The Nation</i></p><h2>The Silver Way: China, Spanish America and the Birth of Globalisation, 1565-1815 (Penguin Specials)</h2><p>Long before London and New York rose to international prominence, a trading route was discovered between Spanish America and China that ushered in a new era of globalization.

In the course of his long career in the northern Italian city of Cremona, he created more than a thousand stringed instruments; approximately six hundred survive. In this fascinating book, Toby Faber traces the rich, multilayered stories of six of these peerless instruments-five violins and a cello-and the one towering artist who brought them into being. <br>Blending history, biography, meticulous detective work, and an abiding passion for music, Faber embarks on an absorbing journey as he follows some of the most prized instruments of all time. Mysteries and unanswered questions proliferate from the outset-starting with the enigma of Antonio Stradivari himself. What made this apparently unsophisticated craftsman so special? Why were his techniques not maintained by his successors? How is it that even two and a half centuries after his death, no one has succeeded in matching the purity, depth, and delicacy of a Stradivarius? <br>In Faber's illuminating narrative, each of the six fabled instruments becomes a character in its own right-a living entity cherished by artists, bought and sold by princes and plutocrats, coveted, collected, hidden, lost, copied, and occasionally played by a musician whose skill matches its maker's. <br>Here is the fabulous Viotti, named for the virtuoso who enchanted all Paris in the 1780s, only to fall foul of the French Revolution. Paganini supposedly made a pact with the devil to transform the art ofthe violin-and by the end of his life he owned eleven Strads. Then there's the Davidov cello, fashioned in 1712 and lovingly handed down through a succession of celebrated artists until, in the 1980s, it passed into the capable hands of Yo-Yo Ma. <br>From the salons of Vienna to the concert halls of New York, from the breakthroughs of Beethoven's last quartets to the first phonographic recordings, Faber unfolds a narrative magnificent in its range and brilliant in its detail. "A great violin is alive," said Yehudi Menuhin of his own Stradivarius. In the pages of this book, Faber invites us to share the life, the passion, the intrigue, and the incomparable beauty of the world's most marvelous stringed instruments. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>Born in Cambridge, England, in 1965, <b>TOBY FABER</b> now lives in London with his wife and daughter.

This book, first published in 1985 by ACS, was Echo&#x2019;s first book and is still her favorite. In her inimital manner, Echo explains to readers what energy or spiritual healing is and how a session works, including how it feels to the healer and the person being healed. Echo&#x2019;s approach to healing could be seen as the traditional Christian "laying on of hands," though the healer sometimes uses their hands on the aura around a person and does not always touch them directly.<br> Hands That Heal addresses concerns and questions that readers may have about healing. In fact, Echo describes such mundane aspects of the process as the room she uses, how people contact her, and how she uses music, incense, and color in her healing space. Details about releasing emotional blocks, avoiding dependency, the dangers of judging anyone&#x2019;s illness, and absentee healing are also provided. Case studies of clients, and line drawings depicting the set-up and positioning of hands, further illustrate how healing works in people&#x2019;s lives.

That's not a very advanced age for a hobbit, of course, but it is still an occasion well worth noting. <em>The Hobbit</em> is a book beloved by millions, and it has served for many as the gateway to a lifelong love of Tolkien's works. Nevertheless, I often feel that <em>The Hobbit</em> lives a little too much in the shadow of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Sitting on a shelf next to the three larger volumes that come after, <em>The Hobbit</em> is easily overlooked, dismissed as a simple, childish "prequel" to Tolkien's great masterpiece. The 75th Anniversary provides a wonderful occasion on which to turn the spotlight back onto this brilliant little book. I can think of no better way to celebrate <em>The Hobbit</em>'s birthday than to give it a good, open-minded re-reading, and my book <em>Exploring J.R.R. Tolkien&#x2019;s "The Hobbit"</em> is my invitation to you to join me in this delightful project.</p> <p>For those of you who are not familiar with my podcast, The Tolkien Professor, let me explain something right away. I know that many people find the idea of "literary criticism" rather tiresome, and the thought of some English professor "dissecting" a book that they hold dear is rather awful. In my book, I seek only to invite you to take a slow stroll through <em>The Hobbit</em> with me, stopping long enough to pay attention to its subtleties and to take note of the larger themes and ideas the story engages with. I won't be examining the book like a lab specimen, but enjoying it with you and sharing with you the things I find so amazing about this book. Whether you are reading <em>The Hobbit</em> for the first time or coming back to it for the thirtieth time, I think you will find that there are always new marvels to discover.</p> <p>To my podcast listeners, let me express my gratitude and my admiration. This book is not only for you, it is also from you; it is the product of your enthusiasm as much as of mine. When I started my podcast in 2009, thinking it would be fun to share some of my thoughts about my favorite books, I had no idea how dynamic, how thoughtful, and how dedicated an audience would find me. I have enjoyed the last three years of discussion, debate, and camaraderie with you enormously. This book is only one of the first fruits to be borne by the branch of the Tree of Story that we have been unfolding together, and I am tremendously excited to see what else we will build together.</p> <p>I hope you will all have the chance to read <em>The Hobbit</em> again this fall, and thanks for joining me on my little adventure.</p> <p>Yours deeply,<br>Corey Olsen</p>HMH hardcover 2012Previous ISBN 978-0-547-73946-5</p><h2>William Bouguereau: The Essential Works</h2><p>� Showcases the work of a realist artist whose work is enjoying a revival<br><br>� Explores Bouguereau's work in new depth, with expert insight into his most important paintings <br><br>William Bouguereau, the most popular artist in nineteenth-century France, is rapidly becoming one of the most popular realist artists of all time. This book is an exploration of the four main types of paintings that were most prevalent throughout Bouguereau's body of work. This includes his mythological works, religious works, peasants, and portraits. This final section on portraits focuses on paintings of heads and hands, which gave the artist the opportunity to concentrate on the subtleties of capturing human emotion, something at which the artist was a consummate master, and is a primary factor in what makes his works, in general, so compelling.<br><br>Although each section of the book discusses the importance of the individual genera within Bouguereau's oeuvre, and includes painting analyses to highlight his most important works, this book is a true showcase of the master's lifetime achievement through beautifully illustrated full-page plates of over 120 of his greatest masterpieces.</p><p>Frederick C.

It was a plastic age, as uncertain as our own, a time when the future was ready to be shaped. <i> Grand Eccentrics</i> is a group biography of a half dozen individuals - Orville and Wilbur Wright; Charles Kettering; John H.

But a fresh corpse is not the only abomination Th�ra encounters here�for local legend says this place is haunted . . . and a bizarre series of inexplicable occurrences soon suggests it is so. </p> <p> As Th�ra digs deeply into the farm's past, she unearths a shocking history of evil and depravity�and her once-solid view of reality begins to waver. But a second murder, shockingly similar to the first, pulls Th�ra back to earth by making two inescapable truths abundantly clear: the killer she seeks is very real . . . and is not finished yet. </p></p><p><p>Yrsa Sigurdard�ttir is an award-winning author of five children's novels and a division manager with one of Iceland's largest engineering firms.

Thora heads out&nbsp;to the coast to consult, looking forward to a weekend without her children. Markedly more cozy and less macabre than the previous book, this one is also slower paced, both in the reading and the investigation. Thora does not believe in the ghost, but when bodies start turning up around the resort, she decides to poke around. The historical elements and leisurely investigation are reminiscent of Indridason&#x2019;s Erlendur series, but it has a much brighter outlook, and unlike Erlendur, Thora is not a depressed, alcoholic loner&#x2014;just a slightly stressed single mom and small-time lawyer.

How did we become a culture that lacks objective morality and embraces secular ideas, hinging on the majority whim of nine justices? How do we get back to being a biblically moral, upright society and recognizing the U.S. Constitution as supreme law of the land? <p></p> In <i>The Legal Basis for a Moral Constitution</i>, Jenna Ellis makes a compelling case for the true roots of America's Founding Documents in objective morality and how our system of government is founded upon the Christian worldview and God's unchanging law, not a secular humanist worldview. She provides a unique perspective of the Founding Fathers as lawyers and how they understood the legitimate authority of biblical truth and appealed directly to God's law for the foundation of America.<p></p> Weaving together the legal history and underpinning worldview shifts in American culture, Ellis advocates how Christians must change the basic reasoning of our appeal and effectively engage our culture. Finally, she proposes the solution to reclaim objective, biblical morality in law that the Founders themselves provided for through Article V of the U.S. Constitution.<p></p> This book is for every Christian who seeks to understand the times and our constitutional and cultural crisis.<p></p></p><p>Jenna Ellis is an attorney, professor of law, and international speaker.

Leading historian Michael F. Holt convincingly offers a disturbingly contemporary answer: partisan politics. In this brilliant and succinct book, Holt distills a lifetime of scholarship to demonstrate that secession and war did not arise from two irreconcilable economies any more than from moral objections to slavery. Short-sighted politicians were to blame. Rarely looking beyond the next election, the two dominant political parties used the emotionally charged and largely chimerical issue of slavery's extension westward to pursue reelection and settle political scores, all the while inexorably dragging the nation towards disunion.</p><p>Despite the majority opinion (held in both the North and South) that slavery could never flourish in the areas that sparked the most contention from 1845 to 1861-the Mexican Cession, Oregon, and Kansas-politicians in Washington, especially members of Congress, realized the partisan value of the issue and acted on short-term political calculations with minimal regard for sectional comity. War was the result.</p><p>Including select speeches by Lincoln and others, <i>The Fate of Their Country</i> openly challenges us to rethink a seminal moment in America's history.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael F. Holt</b> teaches at the University of Virginia and is author of numerous books, including <i>The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party</i> and <i>The Political Crisis of the 1850s</i>, and the co-author of <i>The Civil War and Reconstruction</i> (3rd edition).</p><b>The Fate of their Country</b><br><b>1</b><b>PANDORA'S BOX</b><b>I</b>n the winter of 1860-61, as one Deep South state after another seceded in a furious reaction to the November election of the Republican Abraham Lincoln as President, congressmen frantically sought to devise a compromise that would soothe southern tempers, lure seceded states back into the Union, and avert civil war. The compromisers aimed to reassure Southerners that the almost exclusively northern and now-victorious Republican Party represented no threat to slavery and what were called Southern Rights. So hoping, both the House and the Senate passed a proposed thirteenth amendment to the Constitution, with two-fifths of the Republicans in each chamber voting aye. This amendment would forever have prohibited the federal government from abolishing slavery. This action, so ironic in the context of what became the emancipating Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, hardly satisfied Southerners in 1861. Instead, they demanded that Republicans legalize the extension of slavery into all current and future western territories south of the parallel line thirty-six degrees thirty minutes. Congressional Republicans, pledged from the formation of theirparty in 1854 to bar slavery from all territories and urged by President-elect Lincoln to "hold firm, as with a chain of steel" against any compromise on slavery extension, refused to make that concession. Efforts at compromise collapsed. And the war came.Thus attempts to resolve the secession crisis foundered on the question of slavery's future expansion into southwestern territories, where it did not exist, rather than on its guaranteed perpetuity in the southern states, where it already did. This phenomenon speaks volumes about the causes of the American Civil War. Most historians of the war's causation now agree that the issue that most aggravated sectional conflict during the fifteen years prior to 1861 was slavery's extension beyond the existing slave states, not demands for its abolition within them. That fact raises a host of questions. How and why did the issue of slavery extension emerge? Why did Northerners and Southerners apparently invest so much importance in that issue even when many believed that slavery could not exist profitably in most of the western areas they argued over so furiously? And why did this question prove so intractable? Like a bad weed, the issue popped up again and again after repeated attempts to yank it out had apparently succeeded. Raising the question of slavery's extension into or exclusion from the West truly was opening a Pandora's box of evils, for it could never again be closed. Why?The slavery extension issue first emerged because of decisions by elected officeholders in the executive and especially the legislative branches of the national government in Washington, not because of a groundswell of public pressure for or against territorial and slavery expansion. The point is crucial. Sectional divisions widened in response to what politicians in Washington did; divergent sectional opinions about slavery and basic socialand economic distinctions between the free-labor North and the slave-labor South did not in and of themselves cause those decisions. At few other times in American history did policy makers' decisions have such a profound--and calamitous--effect on the nation as they did in the 1840s and 1850s. Those decisions by themselves, it must be stressed, did not cause the Civil War. As Lincoln later said, that bloody conflict was "a people's contest," not simply a politicians' war. Rather, the decisions were crucial because they did so much to deepen distrust and intensify animosity between the white populations of the North and the South.The slavery extension issue emerged in Congress in its most explosively divisive forms between 1846 and 1854. The issue, however, also arose on two earlier occasions in the nineteenth century with considerable impact on what happened later.In early 1819, southern congressmen bitterly opposed a northern attempt to prevent Missouri's admission as a slave state. The ensuing debate was exceedingly rancorous, and it contained almost all the elements that would characterize sectional controversy over slavery expansion until the Civil War. Northerners condemned slavery as immoral, as economically inefficient, as incompatible with free labor, and as an undemocratic source of southern political power in the national government. They called Southerners already overrepresented in the House of Representatives and electoral college, thanks to the Constitution's three-fifths clause. If Missouri were admitted as a slave state, southern senators would gain a two-seat edge over Northerners. Southerners, in turn, furiously resented Northerners' critique of their "peculiar institution." More important, they worried that if Northerners in Congress could force Missourians to emancipate their slaves as the price of statehood, Northerners would use that precedent to seek the abolition of slaveryin other slave states. That action would violate each state's sacrosanct right to determine its own domestic institutions.The congressional debate over Missouri, while rancorous, was also relatively brief compared with later quarrels over the Mexican Cession and Kansas. In March 1820, Congress passed the Missouri Compromise, even though most Northerners opposed it. By this settlement, Congress admitted Maine as a free state to offset Missouri's admission as a slave state, thus preserving the sectional equilibrium in the Senate. More important, Congress "forever prohibited" slavery in the unorganized area of the Louisiana Purchase territory north of the parallel thirty-six degrees thirty minutes. In the Senate, where all three provisions were bundled together in a single bill, only two of twenty-two Southerners opposed this package, despite its prohibition of slavery from the vast majority of the Louisiana Territory. In the House, where the ban on slavery north of what became famous as the Missouri Compromise line was voted on separately, all Northerners supported the prohibition while Southerners split narrowly 39-37 in its favor. In short, in 1820 a majority of southern congressmen accepted congressional prohibition of slavery from almost all of the western territories. The southern demand thirty-four years later that this prohibition be repealed in the Kansas-Nebraska Act was arguably the single most important turning point on the road to disunion and civil war. That demand clearly reflected a shift in the southern position since 1820, and no action by Congress ever outraged the northern public so much as the repeal of the Missouri Compromise line.The second incident involving slavery's westward extension before 1846 took a different form and had a more immediate impact on subsequent events. In April 1844, President John Tyler asked the Senate to ratify a treaty annexing the pro-slaveryRepublic of Texas, which had won its independence from Mexico in 1836. Here the question was not prohibiting slavery from or allowing slavery into an area largely unoccupied by American citizens. It was whether to add to the Union an area where slavery was already legal, as had happened with the acquisition of Florida from Spain in 1819. More significant, the clash over Texas annexation took a decidedly partisan rather than sectional form. It did so largely because of a crucial intervening development between 1820 and 1844: the emergence of the nation's first truly mass-based two-party political system, a development that would critically affect all subsequent debates over slavery extension.The Missouri crisis debates took a nakedly sectional form because, by 1820, the previous system of party competition between Federalists and Jeffersonian Republicans had collapsed and the Federalist Party had all but disappeared. Without an external foe to provoke internal party discipline and unity, Jeffersonians had fragmented along sectional lines over Missouri. In response, some exceptionally shrewd political leaders sought to revive interparty competition to preclude future sectional conflicts. Of these, New York's Martin Van Buren took the lead in constructing what became the Democratic Party behind Andrew Jackson's presidential candidacy in 1828. Called the "Little Magician" because of his political dexterity, Van Buren wrote a Virginia ally in 1827 that reviving a system of two-party competition between Jackson's friends and enemies would best neutralize "prejudices between the free &amp; slaveholding states." "Party attachment," he declared, had once "furnished a complete antidote to sectional prejudices by producing counteracting feelings." The best way to restore that party loyalty was for northern and southern advocates of states' rights and strict constructionto combine behind Jackson against incumbent President John Quincy Adams, whose broad construal of national power struck states' rights men as anathema.Andrew Jackson's actions during his two terms as President between 1829 and 1837 went far toward reviving partisan attachments. To his avid supporters, Jackson's contempt for established social and economic elites, his determination to remove Indian tribes still east of the Mississippi River from their lands, and his war against the Bank of the United States made him seem a champion of the people against the privileged. His foes, however, regarded Jackson, or "Old Hickory," as his admirers called him, as a potential Caesar. His alleged dictatorial penchant for flouting Congress, the law, and the Constitution endangered the Republic. In 1834 these opponents began to combine under the banner of the new Whig Party. They chose the name to identify themselves with the Revolutionary patriots who had fought King George.Initially, only common opposition to "King Andrew" held Whigs together, and they failed to prevent the election of Van Buren as Jackson's successor in 1836. Within months of Van Buren's inauguration in March 1837, however, a sharp financial panic occurred that qui...</p><h2>Super-Cannes</h2><p><p>A high-tech business park on the Mediterranean coast is the setting for crime of the most disturbing kind in this extraordinary new bestseller from the writer widely regarded as Britain's No 1 living novelist - author of Cocaine Nights.After over three decades at the forefront of modern British fiction writing, J.G. Ballard reached a new generation of readers with the bestselling Cocaine Nights (1996) - an intriguing murder mystery that was also an unnerving vision of a society with too much time on its hands. Now, in Super-Cannes, he delves into another closed community - where this time it is claimed that 'work is the new leisure.' A disturbing mystery awaits Paul and Jane Sinclair when they arrive in Eden-Olympia, a high-tech business park in the hills above Cannes. Jane is to work as a doctor for the executives who live in this ultra-modern workers' paradise. But what caused her apparently sane predecessor to set out one morning and murder ten people in a shooting spree that made headlines around the world? As Paul investigates his new surroundings, he begins to uncover a thriving subculture of crime that is spiralling out of control.</p></p><p><p>J.G. Ballard was born in 1930 in Shanghai. After internment in a civilian prison camp, he and his family returned to England in 1946. He published his first novel, The Drowned World, in 1961. His 1984 bestseller 'Empire of the Sun' won the Guardian Fiction Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. It was later filmed by Steven Spielberg.</p><p>Chapter OneThe first person I met at Eden-Olympia was a psychiatrist, and in many ways it seems only too apt that my guide to this `intelligent&#x2019; city in the hills above Cannes should have been a specialist in mental disorders. I realize now that a kind of waiting madness, like a state of undeclared war, haunted the office buildings of the business park. For most of us, Dr Wilder Penrose was our amiable Prospero, the psychopomp who steered our darkest dreams towards the daylight. I remember his eager smile when we greeted each other, and the evasive eyes that warned me away from his outstretched hand. Only when I learned to admire this flawed and dangerous man was I able to think of killing him.<br><br>Rather than fly from London to Nice, a journey as brief as a plastic-tray lunch, Jane and I decided to drive to the Cote d&#x2019;Azur and steal a few last days of freedom before we committed ourselves to Eden-Olympia and the disciplines of the Euro-corporate lifestyle. Jane was still unsure about her six-month secondment to the business park&#x2019;s private clinic. Her predecessor, a young English doctor named David Greenwood, had met a tragic and still unexplained death after running amok with a rifle. By chance, Jane had known Greenwood when they worked together at Guy&#x2019;s Hospital, and I often thought of the boyishly handsome doctor who could rouse an entire women&#x2019;s ward with a single smile.<br>Memories of Greenwood were waiting for us at Boulogne as the<br>Jaguar left the cross-Channel ferry and rolled its wheels across the quayside. Going into a tabac for a packet of Gitanes - illicit cigarettes had kept both of us sane during my months in hospital Jane bought a copy of <em>Paris Match</em>and found Greenwood&#x2019;s face on the cover, under a headline that referred to the unsolved mystery. As she sat alone on the Jaguar&#x2019;s bonnet, staring at the graphic photographs of murder victims and the grainy maps of the death route, I realized that my spunky but insecure young wife needed to put a few more miles between herself and Eden-Olympia.<br>Rather than overheat either Jane&#x2019;s imagination or the Jaguar&#x2019;s elderly engine, I decided to avoid the Autoroute du Soleil and take the RN7. We bypassed Paris on the Peripherique, and spent our first evening at a venerable hotel in the forest near Fontainebleau, spelling out the attractions of Eden-Olympia to each other and trying not to notice the antique hunting rifle on the dining-room mantelpiece.<br><br>The next day we crossed the olive line, following the long, cicada miles that my mother and father had motored when they first took me to the Mediterranean as a boy. Surprisingly, many of the old landmarks were still there, the family restaurants and literate bookshops, and the light airfields with their casually parked planes that had first made me decide to become a pilot.<br><br>Trying to distract Jane, I talked far too much. During the few months of our marriage I had told my doctor-bride almost nothing about myself, and the drive became a mobile autobiography that unwound my earlier life along with the kilometres of dust, insects and sun. My parents had been dead for two decades, but I wanted Jane to meet them, my hard-drinking, womanizing father, a provincial-circuit barrister, and my lonely, daydreaming mother, always getting over yet another doomed affair.<br><br>At a hotel in Hauterives, south of Lyons, Jane and I sat in the same high-ceilinged breakfast room, unchanged after thirty-five years, where the stags&#x2019; heads still gazed over shelves stocked with the least enticing alcohol I had ever seen. My parents, after their usual bickering breakfast of croissants and coffee helped down by slugs of cognac, had dragged me off to the dream palace of the Facteur Cheval, a magical edifice conjured out of pebbles the old postman collected on his rounds. Working tirelessly for thirty years, he created an heroic doll&#x2019;s house that expressed his simple but dignified dreams of the earthly paradise. My mother tipsily climbed the miniature stairs, listening to my father declaim the postman&#x2019;s naive verses in his resonant baritone. All I could think of, with a ten-year-olds curiosity about my parents&#x2019; sex-lives, was what had passed between them during the night. Now, as I embraced Jane on the parapets of the dream palace, I realized that I would never know.<br><br>Cheval might have survived, but the France of the 1960s, with its Routier lunches, anti-CRS slogans and the Citroen DS, had been largely replaced by a new France of high-speed monorails, MacDo&#x2019;s, and the lavish air-shows that my cousin Charles and I would visit in our rented Cessna when we founded our firm of aviation publishers. And Eden-Olympia was the newest of the new France. Ten miles to the north-east of Cannes, in the wooded hills between Valbonne and the coast, it was the latest of the development zones that had begun with Sophia-Antipohs and would soon turn Provence into Europe&#x2019;s silicon valley.<br><br>Lured by tax concessions and a climate like northern California&#x2019;s, dozens of multinational companies had moved into the business park that now employed over ten thousand people. The senior managements were the most highly paid professional caste in Europe, a new elite of administrators, <i>enarques</i> and scientific entrepreneurs. The lavish brochure enthused over a vision of glass and titanium straight from the drawing boards of Richard Neutra and Frank Gehry, but softened by landscaped parks and artificial lakes, a humane version of Corbusier&#x2019;s radiant city. Even my sceptical eye was prepared to blink.<br><br>Studying the maps, I propped the brochure on my knee-brace as Jane steered the Jaguar through the afternoon traffic on the Grasse road. The stench of raw perfume from a nearby factory filled the car, but Jane wound down her window and inhaled deeply. Our disreputable evening in Arles had revived her, swaying arm in arm with me after a drunken dinner, exploring what I insisted was Van Gogh&#x2019;s canal but turned out to be a stagnant storm-drain behind the archbishop&#x2019;s palace. We had both been eager to get back to our hotel and the well-upholstered bed.<br>The colour was returning to her face, for almost the first time since our wedding. Her watchful eyes and toneless skin were like those of an over-gifted child. Before meeting me, Jane had spent too many hours in elevators and pathology rooms, and the pallor of strip lighting haunted her like a twelve-year-olds memories of a bad dream. But once we left Arles she rose to the challenge of Eden-Olympia, and I could hear her muttering to herself, rehearsing the risque backchat that so intrigued the younger consultants at Guy&#x2019;s.<br><br>`Cheer me up, Paul. How much further?&#x2019;<br>`The last mile - always the shortest one. You must be tired.&#x2019;<br><br>`It&#x2019;s been a lot of fun, more than I thought. Why do I feel so nervous?&#x2019;<br><br>`You don&#x2019;t.&#x2019; I pressed her hand against the wheel, steering the Jaguar around an elderly woman cyclist, panniers filled with baguettes. Jane, you&#x2019;ll be a huge success. You&#x2019;re the youngest doctor on the staff, and the prettiest. You&#x2019;re efficient, hardworking... what else?&#x2019;<br><br>`Slightly insolent?&#x2019;<br>`You&#x2019;ll do them good. Anyway, it&#x2019;s only a business park.&#x2019;<br><br>`I can see it - straight ahead. My God, it&#x2019;s the size of Florida...&#x2019;<br><br>The first office buildings in the Eden-Olympia complex were emerging from the slopes of along valley filled with eucalyptus trees and umbrella pines. Beyond them were the rooftops of Cannes and the Iles de Lerins, a glimpse of the Mediterranean that never failed to lift my heart.<br><br>`Paul, down there...&#x2019; Jane pointed to the hillside, raising a<br>finger still grimy from changing a spark plug. Hundreds of blue ovals trembled like damaged retinas in the Proven~al sun. `What are they rain-traps? Tanks full of Chanel Number S? And those people. They seem to be naked.&#x2019;<br><br>`They are naked. Or nearly. Swimming pools, Jane. Take a good look at your new patients.&#x2019; I watched one senior executive in the garden of his villa, a suntanned man in his fifties with a slim, almost adolescent body, springing lightly on his diving board. `A healthy crowd... I can&#x2019;t imagine anyone here actually bothering to fall ill.&#x2019;<br><br>`Don&#x2019;t be too sure. I&#x2019;ll be busier than you think. The place is probably riddled with airport TB and the kind of viruses that only breed in executive jets. And as for their minds...&#x2019;<br><br>I began to count the pools, each a flare of turquoise light lost behind the high walls of the villas with their screens of cycads and bougainvillaea. Ten thousand years in the future, long after the Cote d&#x2019;Azur had been abandoned, the first explorers would puzzle over these empty pits, with their eroded frescoes of tritons and stylized fish, inexplicably hauled up the mountainsides like aquatic sundials or the altars of a bizarre religion devised by a race of visionary geometers.<br><br>We left the Cannes road and turned onto a landscaped avenue that led towards the gates of the business park. The noise from the Jaguar&#x2019;s tyres fell away as they rolled across a more expensive surface material milled ivory, at the very least - that would soothe the stressed wheels of the stretch limousines. A palisade of Canary palms formed an honour guard along the verges, while beds of golden canvas flamed from the central reservation.<br><br>Despite this gaudy welcome, wealth at Eden-Olympia displayed the old-money discretion that the mercantile rich of the information age had decided to observe at the start of a new millennium. The glass and gunmetal office blocks were set well apart from each other, separated by artificial lakes and forested traffic islands where a latter-day Crusoe could have found comfortable<br>refuge. The faint mist over the lakes and the warm sun reflected from the glass curtain-walling ...</p></p><h2>The Lusiads (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>The first European artist to cross the equator, Camoes's narrative reflects the novelty and fascination of that original encounter with Africa, India and the Far East. The poem's twin symbols are the Cross and the Astrolabe, and its celebration of a turning point in mankind's knowledge of the world unites the old map of the heavens with the newly discovered terrain on earth. Yet it speaks powerfully, too, of the precariousness of power, and of the rise and decline of nationhood, threatened not only from without by enemies, but from within by loss of integrity and vision.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

A soc (short for &#34;social&#34;) has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he&#39;s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy&#39;s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser. This classic, written by S. E. Hinton when she was 16 years old, is as profound today as it was when it was first published in 1967.Ponyboy is fourteen, tough and confused, yet sensitive behind his bold front. Since his parents&#39; death, his loyalties have been to his brothers and his gang, the rough, swinging, long-haired boys from the wrong side of the tracks. When his best friend, Johnny, kills a member of a rival gang, a nightmare of violence begins and swiftly envelops Ponyboy in a turbulent chain of events.</p><h2>Praying Like Paul: Learning to Pray the Kingdom for Those You Love</h2><p>Want to pray better?

Today&#39;s youngsters will be equally moved by the hapless ugly duckling, who, ridiculed and rejected by all, suffers terrible hardships. And they will celebrate along with him when he finally emerges triumphant as the most beautiful swan of all! Bernadette Watts&#39;s detailed illustrations chronicle the bittersweet story with charm and poignancy. Perfect for institutional, trade and gift accounts.</p><p>Three-time Caldecott Honor artist and four-time winner of the Coretta Scott King Award, Jerry Pinkney doesn't disappoint with this lovely, old-fashioned, richly textured watercolor adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's <i>The Ugly Duckling</i>. The mother duck knew from the very beginning that one of her babies would be different from the rest... the sixth egg was large and oddly shaped. When it finally hatches that summer, she thinks the "monstrous big duckling" must be a turkey chick! Other ducks are appalled by the ugly duckling, and he is chased, pecked, and kicked aside. When he can't stand it anymore, he runs away from the pond, eventually taking refuge in the warm cottage of an old woman with a cat and a hen. Missing the delicious feeling of the water too much to stay, however, he heads out again into the wide, increasingly cold autumn world. <blockquote> One day, he heard a sound of whirring wings, and up in the air he saw a flock of birds flying high. They were as bright as the snow that had fallen during the night, and their long necks were stretched southward. Oh, if only he could go with them! But what sort of companion could he be to those beautiful beings?" </blockquote> At last, after a hard, cold winter--and plenty of the kind of adventures no one really wants to have--the duckling sees the same flock of birds he'd seen in the sky so many months ago. He decides he will follow them, somewhat dramatically preferring to be killed by them rather than suffer any more "cold and hunger and cruelty." Much to his surprise, they welcome him! And when he looks for his dull, awkward reflection in the water, he sees a beautiful swan instead. Children who feel ostracized, even for the tiniest of differences, may shed a few sympathetic tears for the ugly duckling. And no doubt, it was Andersen's wish to give them the hope of one day finding their own peaceful place. (Ages 3 to 9) <i>--Karin Snelson</i><p>For over one hundred years <em>The Ugly Duckling</em> has been a childhood favorite, and Jerry Pinkney's spectacular new adaptation brings it triumphantly to new generations of readers. With keen emotion and fresh vision, the acclaimed artist captures the essence of the tale's timeless appeal: The journey of the awkward little bird -- marching bravely through hecklers, hunters, and cruel seasons -- is an unforgettable survival story; this blooming into a graceful swan is a reminder of the patience often necessary to discover true happiness. Splendid watercolors set in the lush countryside bring drama to life.</p></p><h2>Erasmus and Luther: The Battle over Free Will (Hackett Classics)</h2><p><p>This compilation of writings from Erasmus and Luther's great debate--over free will and grace, and their respective efficacy for salvation--offers a fuller representation of the disputants' main arguments than has ever been available in a single volume in English. Included are key, corresponding selections from not only Erasmus' conciliatory <i>A Discussion or Discourse concerning Free Will</i> and Luther's forceful and fully argued rebuttal, but--with the battle now joined--from Erasmus' own forceful and fully argued rebuttal of Luther. Students of Reformation theology, Christian humanism, and sixteenth-century rhetoric will find here the key to a wider appreciation of one of early modern Christianity&#x2019;s most illuminating and disputed controversies.</p></p><p><p>Clarence H. Miller is Professor Emeritus of English, St. Louis University.</p><p>Peter Macardle is Lecturer in German in the School of Modern Languages and Cultures, Durham University.</p><p>James D. Tracy is Professor Emeritus of History, University of Minnesota.</p><p>Among the most dramatic exchanges in Western intellectual history was the confrontation between Erasmus and Luther over freedom of the will--or, as Luther conceived of it, bound choice. Clarence H. Miller provides extensive selections from both sides of this vital debate--from Erasmus' <i>A Discussion or Discourse concerning Free Will</i>; from Luther's reply, <i>The Enslaved Will</i>; and from Erasmus' extensive rebuttal, <i>The Shield-Bearer Defending 'A Discussion'</i>--outfitting them with helpful notes that bring readers into the world of the texts. James D. Tracy's Introduction masterfully and concisely depicts the two participants in this literary disputation, the concerns that governed their thinking, and the intellectual context of their debate&#x2014;one that still offers much to readers reflecting on what it means to be human in our own age. --Robert A. Kolb, Missions Professor of Systematic Theology Emeritus, Concordia Seminary</p><br><br><p>Erasmus has the first and last word in this version of the famous debate on free will. He needs all the help he can get, given that Luther captivates the readers with his scathing wit, pristine deductive logic, and pithy if dismissive rejoinders. . . . This volume of substantial excerpts translated by Clarence H. Miller and Peter Macardle . . . provides Reformation scholars with the most comprehensive existing treatment of the exchange between Erasmus and Luther on the Reformation exegesis, philosophy, and politics of free will, grace, and Law. The comprehensive and detailed biographical and theological introduction concisely covers the cultural history and the central doctrinal issues informing the debate, most notably the Pauline influences." --Alice Crawford Berghof, English, UC Irvine (adapted from <i>Comitatus</i>)</p><br><br><p>As James D. Tracy notes in the excellent introduction to Clarence H. Miller's Erasmus and Luther: <i>The Battle over Free Will</i>, 'In the history of the European Reformation, few issues were as important as the one debated by Erasmus and Luther: Are human beings capable of contributing to their own salvation by what they choose to do or not to do?' Miller's edition provides a more comprehensive view of the debate than the usual English texts used in classrooms and accurately reflects the history of the debate. Miller and Macardle's translation is clear and flows well. Compared to Winter&#x2019;s text, this edition offers a stronger supportive apparatus, including helpful notes and an updated bibliography. Erasmus' and Luther's debate over the freedom of the will remains a central point of access to the study of the Reformation. It highlights the fundamental issues of the Reformation as well as the differences between those eager for reform within the Church and those who believed that the Church was so fundamentally off track that no reform could sufficiently set it right. Luther's vehemence and self-assurance in <i>The Enslaved Will</i> say almost as much about his reform movement as his arguments do. Erasmus' three efforts to defend the freedom of the will demonstrate not only his nuanced approach to theology, Scripture, and Church tradition, but also his concern for the consequences of Church schism." --Greta Grace Kroeker, History, University of Waterloo (condensed from <i>Erasmus of Rotterdam Society Yearbook</i>)</p></p><h2>Givenness and Revelation</h2><p><em>Givenness and Revelation</em> represents both the unity and the deep continuity of Jean-Luc Marions thinking over many decades. This investigation into the origins and evolution of the concept of revelation arises from an initial reappraisal of the tension between natural theology and the revealed knowledge of God or sacra doctrina. Marion draws on the re-definition of the notions of possibility and impossibility, the critique of the reification of the subject, and the unpredictability of the 'event' in its relationship to the phenomenology of the gift. <br><br>This work begins and ends in the concept of revelation, thus addressing the very heart and soul of Marion's theology, concluding with a phenomenological approach to the Trinity that rests in the Spirit as gift. <em>Givenness and Revelation</em> enhances not only our understanding of religious experience, but enlarges the horizon of possibility of phenomenology itself.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jean-Luc Marion</strong>, <em>Member of the French Academy, Emeritus professor Universite Paris-Sorbonne, Professor at the University of Chicago Divinity School</em><br><br><strong>Jean-Luc Marion</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at the Universite Paris-Sorbonne (Paris IV), and the John Nuveen Distinguished Professor in the Divinity School and Professor in the Committee on Social Thought and the Department of Philosophy at the University of Chicago.<br><br>Dr Stephen Lewis is Professor and Chair of English Department at Franciscan University of Steubenville.<br><br>"Marion is right to identify givenness and revelation as foundational concepts for phenomenology and theology respectively. His Gifford Lectures helpfully fill out his interest in revelation as a pre-eminent example of phenomenality."--Shane Mackinlay, <em>Modern Theology</em><p></p><br>"<em>Giveness and Revelation</em> takes in wide historical horizons.For arion the uniqueness of the doctrine of the Trinity lies in its revelation of a unity consisting in love, 'put into operation as communion.' He counters the protest that hristianity betrays the monotheism of the other Abrahamic religions by arguing that Trinitarian theology discloses a unity "well beyond the empty unicity of numeration"." -- Clare Carlisle, Times Literary Supplement<p></p><br></p><h2>A Concise Introduction to Mixed Methods Research</h2><p><strong>John W.

Noddings looks at education as a multi-aim enterprise in which schools must address needs in all three domains of life: home and family, occupational, and civic. She raises critical questions about the current enthusiasm for standardization, the search for &#x201c;one-best-way&#x201d; solutions, and the practice of maintaining a sharp separation between the disciplines. Comprehensive in its scope, chapters examine the liberal arts curriculum, vocational education, restructuring secondary school, extracurricular activities, national and global citizenship, critical thinking, and moral education.</p> <p>Noddings argues that we must find ways to preserve our commitment to democratic values while adapting to the societal changes that have occurred since Dewey wrote <em>Democracy and Education</em> almost a century ago. She urges not only a critical appraisal of current practice but also a cooperative and imaginative exploration of the future.</p></p><p><p><br> &#x201c;Noddings describes goals for our schools that are at odds with the leaders of both political parties.

And yet it has excused, and even been thought to justify, the most reprehensible crimes. Why should this be? This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> explores this and other puzzling questions. Do we love someone for their virtue, their beauty, or their moral or other qualities? Are love's characteristic desires altruistic or selfish? Are there duties of love? What do the sciences - neuroscience, evolutionary and social psychology, and anthropology - tell us about love?<br><br>Many of the answers we give to such questions are determined not so much by the facts of human nature as by the ideology of love. Ronald de Sousa considers some of the many paradoxes raised by love, looking at the different kinds of love - affections, affiliation, <em>philia, storage, agape</em>, but focusses on <em>eros</em>, or romantic love. He considers whether our conventional beliefs about love and sex are deeply irrational and argues that alternative conceptions of love and sex, although hard to formulate and live by, may be worth striving for.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong><br>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

In the United States, black women are over three times more likely to perish from pregnancy-related complications than white women; their babies are half as likely to survive the first year. Many black women experience policing, coercion, and disempowerment during pregnancy and childbirth and are disconnected from alternative birthing traditions. This book places black women&#39;s voices at the center of the debate on what should be done to fix the broken maternity system and foregrounds black women&#39;s agency in the emerging birth justice movement.

He declares it to be the expression of a culture which has achieved a delicate but powerful balance between Dionysian insight into the chaos and suffering which underlies all existence and the discipline and clarity of rational Apollonian form. In order to promote a return to these values, Nietzsche critiques complacent rationalism of late nineteenth-century German culture and makes an impassioned plea for the regenerative potential of the music of Wagner. A wide ranging discussion of the nature of art, science, and religion, <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>'s argument raises important questions about the problematic nature of cultural origins which are still valid today.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>The Birth of Tragedy (1872) was Nietzsche's first book. Its youthful faults were exposed by Nietzsche in the brilliant "Attempt at a Self-Criticism" which he added to the new edition of 1886. But the book, whatever its excesses, remains one of the most relevant statements on tragedy ever penned. It exploded the conception of Greek culture that was prevalent down through the Victorian era, and it sounded themes developed in the twentieth century by classicists, existentialists, psychoanalysts, and others. <br> <br>The Case of Wagner (1888) was one Nietzsche's last books, and his wittiest. In attitude and style it is diametrically opposed to The Birth of Tragedy. Both works transcend their ostensible subjects and deal with art and culture, as well as the problems of the modern age generally. <br> <br>Each book in itself gives us an inadequate idea of its author; together, they furnish a striking image of Nietzsche's thought. The distinguished new translations by Walter Kaufmann superbly reflect in English Nietzsche's idiom and the vitality of his style. Professor Kaufmann has also furnished running footnote commentaries, relevant passages from Nietzsche's correspondence, a bibliography, and, for the first time in any edition, an extensive index to each book.Douglas Smith is a Lecturer in French at the University College, Dublin.</p><h2>Excel Modeling in Corporate Finance</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in corporate finance or financial management at the undergraduate and graduate level.</i> </p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>Excel Modeling in Corporate Finance</i> </b> approaches building and estimating models with Microsoft� Excel�.

Matthew Kelly Between 2000 and 2003, Matthew lost three people very close to him to cancer. Matthew's father died in August 2003 after a two-year struggle with cancer. During his father's illness, Matthew would jot down different inspirational quotes on note cards and send them to his father in Australia. His father would often comment on how these bit-sized portions of inspiration brought a simple focus and joy to his daily struggle. After his father's death, Matthew decided to pull all the quotes together and publish them as a book, accompanied by an essay explaining the role of courage in our lives.

When their cave is attacked by humans, Wistala escapes and tries to save her father. After being rescued by an elf, Tala learns to speak the language of men, becomes a Citizen landowner, and realizes that her family still lives. Narrator David Drummond shifts adroitly from the lyrical prose of the dragon family to the rough Scottish brogue of the dwarves and the light, musical voices of the elves. Drummond makes Tala&#39;s confusion while trying to break free of her egg, her rage over the apparent destruction of her family, and her growing affection for Rainfall the elf believable and engaging.

Drafted into the army during World War II, Preussler was captured in 1944 and spent the next five years as a prisoner of war in the Tatar Republic. After his release, he moved to Bavaria and became a primary-�school teacher and principal, supplementing his income by working as a reporter for a local newspaper and by writing scripts for children&#x2019;s radio.

His son is the artist Jan Peter Tripp.Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;When the infamous robber Hotzenplotz makes off with Grandmother's coffee mill, clever Kasperl and his best friend Seppel must use all their cunning, along with a little help from the frog-fairy Amaryllis, to retrieve the mill and bring the rapscallion to justice. This new translation of this work, originally published in 1962, positively crackles with the quirky energy and sparkling humor that made it a classic of German children's literature. Kasperl traces his origins to the eponymous hero character of traditional German puppet theater, who in turn has his roots in the commedia dell'arte character Pulcinella. This foundation provides a strong archetypal resonance that elementary-aged readers will connect to. Kids will especially enjoy reading about good-hearted Kasperl and Seppel, who deftly overcome nasty villains and comically ineffectual authority figures, emerging victorious in the end. Fairy-tale and fantasy elements stay true to the story's Kasperle puppet theater genre roots, from the wicked magician Petrosilius Zackleman to the wishing ring bestowed on the protagonists by the frog-fairy Amaryllis. Preussler's razor-sharp humor and wordplay shine throughout, and the episodic chapters, usually no more than four or five pages long, practically beg to be read aloud. Tripp's pen-and-ink illustrations complement, expand on, and deepen the story.

The earth had rotated a bit and the dappling shadow of the trees fell across the police cruiser, leaving the woman in shade. &#x201c;How far you go?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I do about ten miles,&#x201d; Newman said. &#x201c;Three days a week I run up to the health club and lift a little.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Losing any weight?&#x201d; Tinkham said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah. Maybe twenty, twenty-five pounds so far,&#x201d; Newman said. He was conscious of saying yeah. A regular guy. One of the boys. At ease with cops and jocks and guys that played pool for money.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the crows made a swoop over the dead woman and didn&#x2019;t dare. He kept in the air and circled back up to the tree branch. There were five crows there now.<br> &nbsp;<br> Diamond came back from the cruiser. &#x201c;Couple of staties coming down from the Smithfield barracks,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Alden says don&#x2019;t touch anything till they get here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Tinkham nodded. &#x201c;You want to write?&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Diamond said, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Tinkham squatted down again beside the woman. &#x201c;Female,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Black, age&#x201d;&#x2014;he shrugged&#x2014;&#x201c;twenty to thirty, white slacks, yellow halter top, black sling-strap high-heel shoe (one), one shoe missing, gold hoop earrings.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Diamond said, &#x201c;You sure there&#x2019;s two?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You want to turn her head and look?&#x201d; Tinkham said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Diamond said &#x201c;No&#x201d; and continued to write in his notebook.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Large gold ring on index finger of right hand, picture of a queen on it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Diamond said, &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Picture of a queen,&#x201d; Tinkham said. &#x201c;How the fuck do I know who it is. You know?&#x201d; He looked at Newman.<br> &nbsp;<br> Newman leaned closer. You get used to anything. The woman&#x2019;s hand was sprawled out away from her body and Newman could look at the ring without seeing the shattered skull.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nefertiti,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Diamond looked at him. Tinkham said, &#x201c;Or at least not often.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the King Tut craze,&#x201d; Newman said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Diamond said, &#x201c;Never mind.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Victim is prostrate on left side, appears to have been shot several times in right rear quarter of head.

They wore campaign hats and black boots. Their faces glistened with the closeness of their shaves. Their uniform shirts were pressed with military creases. Their gunbelts glowed with polish. Their hair barely showed under the hats. The sideburns were trimmed short. One was black.<br> &nbsp;<br> The white trooper said to Diamond, &#x201c;Touch anything?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Diamond shook his head.<br> &nbsp;<br> The black trooper looked down at the woman. &#x201c;Black,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What the hell she doing out here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Tinkham said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. She don&#x2019;t live around here, though.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The black trooper looked at Tinkham for ten seconds, then he said, &#x201c;No shit?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Tinkham&#x2019;s face reddened. &#x201c;Maybe she was selling watermelon,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> The black trooper smiled. Once. A smile that came on and went off. He looked down at the woman. &#x201c;Junkie,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> The white trooper said, &#x201c;Tracks?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The black trooper nodded. &#x201c;All up and down her right arm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The white trooper said to Newman, &#x201c;You see the shooting?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Newman said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Could you identify the killer?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Newman said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure I could.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Search for the Red Dragon (2) (Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica, The)</h2><p><b>"'The Crusade has begun'...</b> <br> <br> <i>"There's an old myth in the Archipelago," he went on softly, shaking his head.

Their parents never heard it, for the tune had not been intended for them. </p><p> It was a song played for children; and when they heard it, the children came. </p><p> Half-asleep and barefoot, still in their nightshirts, the children climbed from their beds and through windows that had been opened, unknowingly, to let in the cool breezes of evening. </p><p> They walked, entranced, down winding lanes that converged into a single path that none of them had ever seen before, but that had always been there. </p><p> It had many names, for it was only ever walked by children, and children have a fondness for naming things. But each child, as they passed, knew it for what it truly was -- the Road to Paradise. They knew this, because the song they heard told them so. </p><p> The notes of the music seemed to emanate from all around them, played everywhere and nowhere all at once, and the music maker, when they glimpsed him in the twilight air, seemed to change shape in time with the music. </p><p> His flickering, ghostlike form was sometimes a grown-up, and other times a child like themselves. And sometimes he seemed not to be human at all. The music told them his name: the King of Crickets. And none of them could resist the song he played. </p><p> None, save for one. </p><p> She had been cautioned that one day the King of Crickets would come, and that unless she was prepared, she would not be able to resist his song. No children could, unless they were crippled, and could not follow, or were unable to hear the tune and fall under its spell. </p><p> The beeswax she put into her ears, as the dream had told her to do, kept out enough of the music for her to resist its lure -- but not so completely that she couldn't feel the desire, nor hold back the tears that streamed onto her pillow as she finally slept, still dreaming of Paradise. </p><p> For some children, the path ended at a great mountain face that split open to embrace them, and closed as they passed through. For others, it ended at a great precipice, which they stepped over, willingly, because the song told them they could fly. But for most, it led them to the Men of Iron, and the great ships that departed with the dawn. </p><p> In the light of morning, the path would again vanish, but it would have a new name: the Sorrow Road. </p><p> As they awoke to find the beds of their sons and daughters empty, the mothers and fathers in the towns and villages would feel bewilderment, then fear, and then terror. And they would name the path with their cries. </p><p> But it was too late. Much, much too late. </p></i><p><i> The children were already gone.</i> </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2008 by James A. Owen </p><p> </p> CHAPTER ONE <p> <i>The Angel in the Garden</i> </p> <p> </p><p> John rarely dreamed, and it was even more seldom that he could recall what he dreamed about. But as of late, he had had dreams every night, and he remembered them all -- because when he dreamed, he dreamed of Giants. </p><p> Massive continents of bone and sinew, creating their own topographies as they strode across the landscapes, giving little notice to the awed creatures watching from below. The Giants were so great it seemed they had both gravity and weightlessness; as if the next thundering step would suddenly launch them into space, to join with the gods and Titans among the constellations. </p><p> Standing with the populace of his dream world (all of whom, strangely, seemed to be children), John watched in mute wonder as the Giants strode past with geological slowness. Then, as in each of the dreams, one of the Giants turned and looked down, directly at John. Shifting its weight, it bent and reached for him with a hand the size of a barn as the children around him began shrieking.... </p><p> The train whistle was shrill in the afternoon air, startling John out of his troubled reverie. He stood and quickly scanned the crowd departing the train that had just come in from London. The station at Oxford was not large, but the afternoon schedules were always full of both comings and goings, and he didn't want to miss the person for whom he was waiting. </p><p> He realized with a rising thrill that he was far more excited to see his old friend than he'd expected to be. They had, in point of fact, spent only a few weeks together a number of years before -- but the events of those days were enough to make them closer than mere colleagues. And so when the thin, nervous-looking man with the high forehead and round spectacles finally emerged from the train onto the platform, John rushed forward and greeted him like a brother. </p><p> "Charles!" he exclaimed joyfully. "I say, it's terribly good to see you!" </p><p> "I'm very pleased to see you, too, John," said Charles, clapping his friend on the back. "It's odd -- as I got closer and closer to Oxford, I kept feeling as if I was coming home. But it wasn't because of the place -- rather because I knew I was going to be seeing you and Jack. Does that sound strange to you?" </p><p> "Yes," replied John, chuckling, "but in all the right ways. Come on -- let me help you with your bags." </p><p> As they loaded Charles's belongings into John's vehicle, Charles looked around nervously and leaned closer to his friend. "I wanted to ask," he said in a conspiratorial whisper, "do you, ah, do you, you know, have, ah, 'it' with you?" </p><p> "Of course," said John, pointing to a bundle of books and papers on the rear seat. "It's there in the middle somewhere." </p><p> Charles's eyes widened in shock. "Here? Out in the open?" he exclaimed. "Not locked away or anything? John, are you out of your mind? That's, that's..." He lowered his voice again. "That's the Imaginarium Geographica. The single most valuable book on Earth. Don't you think it's a bit, ah, risky?" </p><p> "Not at all," John said with a trace of smugness. "Take a look at the lecture on top of the pile." </p><p> Charles adjusted his spectacles and peered more closely at the document. "It says, 'A proposal for syllabus reform as regards the study of Ancient Icelandic.' And the rest appear to be notes on courses in Comparative Philologies." </p><p> He climbed into the seat next to John and gave his friend a puzzled look. "Don't take this the wrong way, but how many people, even at Oxford, would care about such things?" </p><p> "Precisely my thinking," said John as he started up the car. "I have a hard enough time getting the undergraduates to pay any attention to Anglo-Saxon, much less Old Icelandic. What better protection for the <i>Geographica</i> than to bury it amongst manuscripts that no one else will care about?" </p><p> </p><p> It had been nine years to the day since John and Charles had met each other in London. Nine years since they and the companion they were going to see had gone on the most extraordinary expedition of their lives. </p><p> Exceptional circumstances had brought the three young men together at the scene of a murder. The dead man, John's mentor, Professor Sigurdsson, had been one of the Caretakers of the <i>Imaginarium Geographica.</i> </p><p> The <i>Geographica</i> was an atlas of maps of a place called the Archipelago of Dreams -- a great chain of islands that had been coexisting with our own world since time began and had influenced many of the great men and women of history. </p><p> But not all of those influenced by the Archipelago were influenced for the better. </p><p> A man called the Winter King tried to use the <i>Geographica</i> and the knowledge found within to conquer the Archipelago. Another Caretaker, Bert, enlisted John and his two friends to travel into the Archipelago to try to stop the Winter King. And somehow, despite terrible odds, they managed to do it. </p><p> The Winter King lost, and fell to his death over the edge of an endless waterfall. A new order was established in the Archipelago, under a new king and queen. And the <i>Geographica</i> now had three new Caretakers: John, Charles, and the youngest of the three friends, Jack. </p><p> But there had been prices paid for their victory. Allies were lost. Mistakes were made. And although there had been a measure of redemption, there were some events that would never be far from their thoughts. </p><p> Events in the Archipelago resonate with those in our world -- which was then still in the midst of World War I. John resumed his service in the military just as Jack began his. Only Charles was spared, due to his general nervous nature and age. And when finally, the war ended, they all resumed their lives as if the war, and their adventure in the Archipelago, had been imaginary aberrations, or dreams. </p><p> And perhaps John could have convinced himself that it all <i>had</i> been a dream, if it were not for the great leatherbound book that he still possessed. He had not had so much as a message from Bert since the old tatterdemalion had returned them to London aboard the <i>White Dragon</i> -- one of the great living Dragonships that were able to cross the boundary between our world and the Archipelago. </p><p> At least, John mused, there hadn't been any more murders. Or another war. He didn't think the planet could survive a second war on the scale of the one they'd come through. But then again, much of the responsibility for those events could be attributed to the Winter King -- and he had been dealt with. </p><p> John had been working in his study at Oxford when the messenger boy arrived with the note from Jack's brother Warren that requested he come to see Jack immediately. As he was reading it, the telephone rang. John picked it up and was happily surprised to find Charles on the other end, having just received a telegram of his own. In short order, arrangements were made for Charles to travel to Oxford, where he and John could meet and then go together to see Jack. </p><p> When they had parted ways in London years earlier, they had made a pact to never contact one another except in the event of a situation arising that involved the care of the <i>Geographica,</i> or the Archipelago, or in case of another extreme emergency. It was, they decided, the only way to protect t...</p></p><h2>Structural Integration and Energy Medicine: A Handbook of Advanced Bodywork</h2><p>An illustrated guide to the Structural Integration bodywork process and the relationship between body alignment and energy flow <br><br>� Details each of the 10 sessions in the Structural Integration bodywork series, explaining what to expect and how to maximize the benefits <br><br>� Explores the relationship between the energetics of the body and its alignment, including a scientific understanding of how gravity affects body alignment <br><br>� Explains how to incorporate essential oils and other holistic support tools as well as the psycho-emotional Hellerwork themes <br><br>When the body&#x2019;s structure is optimally aligned, not only does it eliminate pain, reduce inflammation, and stop the degeneration of joints and discs, it also enhances the flow of energy in the body and awakens us to greater mental clarity. <br><br>In this illustrated guide to Dr. Ida P. Rolf&#x2019;s Structural Integration process, Jean Louise Green introduces the principles of Structural Integration and details each of the 10 sessions in the Structural Integration bodywork series, explaining what to expect and how to maximize the benefits. She explores the relationship between the energetics of the body and its alignment, including an advanced scientific understanding of how gravity can become a beneficial force when the body is properly aligned. She provides clear, accessible descriptions of core concepts such as the Rolf Line and the torus, including a detailed explanation of how to access the energetics of the Rolf Line. She illustrates the rotation patterns of the body and explains how they contribute to pain and how correcting them may minimize the need for hip and knee replacements. She provides movement exercises and support tools for self-care and maintenance between sessions and explains optimal body mechanics for moving, sitting, and standing as well as how to avoid putting stress and strain back into the body. This book is an excellent resource guide to accompany a person through their Structural Integration series. <br><br>The author also explores how to incorporate Joseph Heller&#x2019;s psycho-emotional Hellerwork themes in the Structural Integration process and looks at holistic support tools such as electromagnetic resonancing, far-infrared saunas, essential oils, gratitude practices, meditation, and the Five Tibetan yogic exercises. <br><br>Offering an energy medicine approach to bodywork, this guide provides both practitioners and laypeople with the necessary tools to dramatically increase the efficiency of the body, release chronic pain, improve mental function, and free energy flow.</p><p>Jean Louise Green, CMT, is a certified Rolf practitioner, trained by Dr. Ida P.

Formulate your goals and intentions. Doing this will enhance the benefits of your ten-sessions investment. <br><br>The body has a great capacity to shift with this work. Changes may be noticed immediately upon standing after the session or experienced through an accumulated effect during the series. Toward the end of your ten-session series, the majority of the ailments on your list may be completely forgotten or significantly improved. Each person&#x2019;s experience of the work will be unique according to their own body&#x2019;s needs and personal history. <br><br>Because of the connection between body, mind, emotion, and spirit, you might consider not only physical goals but also personal goals. This work is a springboard for creating major positive change. It can usher in the next level of who you are becoming. With that in mind, what is it in your life that you would like to bring in or accomplish at this time? <br><br><b>The Theme of the First Session</b> <br><br>Joseph Heller is a respected early colleague of Dr. Ida Rolf and a former president of the Rolf Institute. He is the founder of Hellerwork Structural Integration and an authority on the emotions and their effects on different parts of the body. Heller&#x2019;s brilliant, insightful themes add new depth to the work. He realized that most people&#x2019;s stress is mental and emotional in origin, and that stress gets stuck in different parts of the body. <br><br>Joseph Heller described the theme of the first session as &#x201c;Inspiration&#x201d;: &#x201c;The meaning of the word &#x2018;inspiration&#x2019; is &#x2018;draw in spirit&#x2019;: inspiration is not only to inhale oxygen, but it is also to be filled with--or to be in touch with--spirit.&#x201d; Breath is our prime connection with life force. <br><br>The first session can be an inspiration for being able to breathe deeply and fully give and receive love. The spirit of the first session is of being reborn--of something special having happened.<br><br>The psychological Hellerwork connection here is the reawakening of an enthusiasm for life; a possibility of newfound freedom in body, mind, emotion, and spirit. Emmett Hutchins, my first teacher of Dr. Rolf&#x2019;s work, described the mood of the first hour when he said, &#x201c;One of the qualities of a first hour is &#x2018;Wow! That was wonderful. I&#x2019;ve never had anything like that before. Can I get more?&#x2019;&#x201d; <br><br><b>Dr. Rolf&#x2019;s Words about the First Session</b> <br><br>&#x201c;The goals are to improve chest respiration and the nutrition in the cellular levels. The new blood opens up the way to mobilization and innervation of the pelvic body from the earth in all subsequent sessions.&#x201d; <br><br>Practitioner Goals for the First Session<br> <br>� Create awareness of client&#x2019;s baseline structure. <br>� Establish a working relationship. <br>� Open up the breathing capacity.<br>� Lengthen the front of the body.<br>� Begin to release restrictions in the pelvic and shoulder girdles. <br>� Begin to free the legs.<br>� Horizontalize the pelvis.<br>� Introduce client to their Line for the first time. Acquaint the client with where the top of their head is and where their feet are in relation to the gravitational field.<br><br><b>Areas Addressed</b> <br><br>The front of the body will be longer after this session. The work will create the need for the lengthening of the back in session two. This is the beginning of freeing strain in the rib cage, shoulder girdle, legs, hips, neck, and back. <br><br>As a result of the first session, breathing capacity may expand by 25 percent. More of your weight may be on your heels. Also, the ribs may lift as the weight bearing down into your feet has shifted. <br><br><b>Self-Care for the Client after a First Session</b><br><br>The work of Structural Integration helps break up patterns of disorganization that are stuck in the soft tissues of the body. The stretching and breaking down of such tissues releases toxins that may cause the body to feel sore after a session. <br><br><i>Take a ten-minute walk immediately after your structural integration session</i> to help your body integrate the work. Walking will help your body adjust to its changes in alignment and relationship with gravity.<br><br><i>Follow the walk with a detox bath to help eliminate toxins</i> quickly through the skin. Detox baths lessen side effects from the release of toxins during your sessions. Otherwise, side effects could include dizziness, headache, nausea, body ache, fever, or flu-like symptoms. If toxins are not removed from the body <i>within six hours</i>, they can move back into the blood stream into deeper layers of the connective tissues causing soreness in the body. If any soreness remains after your detox bath, rub some arnica gel into the area. Arnica increases circulation and reduces inflammation and pain. As long as there is inflammation, pain will be present. Inflammation needs to be reduced in order to diminish pain.<br><br><i>Increase your water intake before and after your sessions.</i> Water rehydrates the connective tissues and helps flush out toxins released in the bodywork. It is recommended to drink half of one&#x2019;s bodyweight in ounces of water per day. <br><br><i>Increase the intake of protein</i> in your diet during your Structural Integration series to help support the formation of new connective tissues during this time of reorganization in your body. <br><br><b>Between the Sessions <br></b><br>Because the psyche and soma are so connected, the practitioner&#x2019;s work around the rib cage may cause feelings to surface during or after the session. Often with the freeing of the breath can come a reawakened enthusiasm for life; however, there can also be sadness as repressed emotions begin to stir. <br><br>Did any feelings come up for you during or after the session? Did this surprise you? How did you handle those emotions? Was it okay for you to feel the feelings or did you try to stifle them? This might be an opportunity for you to clear some of those feelings on the mental and emotional levels and get them &#x201c;off your chest.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Grave Maurice</h2><p>"Chew on this," says Melrose Plant to Richard Jury, who's in the hospital being driven crazy by Hannibal, a nurse who likes to speculate on his chances for survival. Jury could use a good story, preferably one not ending with his own demise.<p>Plant tells Jury of something he overheard in The Grave Maurice, a pub near the hospital. A woman told an intriguing story about a girl named Nell Ryder, granddaughter to the owner of the Ryder Stud Farm in Cambridgeshire, who went missing more than a year before and has never been found. What is especially interesting to Plant is that Nell is also the daughter of Jury's surgeon.</p><p>But Nell's disappearance isn't the only mystery at the Ryder farm. A woman has been found dead on the track-a woman who was a stranger even to the Ryders.</p><p>But not to Plant. She's the woman he saw in The Grave Maurice. Together with Jury, Nell's family, and the Cambridgeshire police, Plant embarks on a search to find Nell and bring her home. But is there more to their mission than just restoring a fifteen-year-old girl to her family?</p><p><b>The Grave Maurice</b> is the eighteenth entry in the Richard Jury series and, from its pastoral opening to its calamitous end, is full of the same suspense and humor that devoted readers expect from Martha Grimes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>In this, the 18th outing in Martha Grimes's popular series featuring Scotland Yard Superintendent Richard Jury and his aristocrat pal Melrose Plant, Jury, recuperating from a near-fatal shooting (<i>The Blue Last</i>) hears about the two-year-old abduction of his doctor's talented young daughter, Nell Ryder, who disappeared from her grandfather's stud farm, along with a champion thoroughbred horse. Pursuing the stalled investigation when he's released from the hospital, Jury stumbles on a complicated scheme involving murder, insurance fraud, and a scheme to replicate a popular menopause drug derived from the urine of pregnant mares. As readers of this popular series know, while there's a mystery at the heart of every Jury novel, the real payoff is in Grimes's lucent prose, wit, and complex characterizations. Fans of British mystery writer Dick Francis, who's made the world of thoroughbreds his own turf, will find this a delightful diversion, particularly since Francis recently announced his retirement from the genre. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Martha Grimes is the bestselling author of eighteen Richard Jury mysteries and also the acclaimed fiction <b>Foul Matter</b>, <b>Cold Flat Junction</b>, <b>Hotel Paradise</b>, <b>The End of the Pier</b>, and <b>The Train Now Departing</b>.<p> </p></p><h2>Stranger in the Forest: On Foot Across Borneo</h2><p>Eric Hansen was the first westerner ever to walk across the island of Borneo. Completely cut off from the outside world for seven months, he traveled nearly 1,500 miles with small bands of nomadic hunters known as Penan. Beneath the rain forest canopy, they trekked through a hauntingly beautiful jungle where snakes and frogs fly, pigs climb trees, giant carnivorous plants eat mice, and mushrooms glow at night. <br><br>At once a modern classic of travel literature and a gripping adventure story, <b>Stranger in the Forest</b> provides a rare and intimate look at the vanishing way of life of one of the last surviving groups of rain forest dwellers. Hansen's absorbing, and often chilling, account of his exploits is tempered with the humor and humanity that prompted the Penan to take him into their world and to share their secrets.</p><p>Eric Hansen lives in San Francisco, California.Hansen's adventurous walk across Borneo took place in the 1980s, but the forest and culture that he encountered have changed little during the past century. Though he documents his reactions to isolation and to the tropical forest environment and its culture, he is not successful in describing the indigenous people or the forest; a more sophisticated treatment would have enriched the reader's experience. Despite this weakness he conveys the drama of the adventure, not least his navete in undertaking such an effort with such little planning. James R.

The Bible touches on science, but it is not a scientific textbook. It provides insights into the human mind but is not a treatise on psychology. Although God&#39;s Word touches on a variety of disciplines, it is first and foremost a revelation of God&#39;s will, revealing God&#39;s eternal truths to the human race. The Bible answers the three great questions of life: &#34;Why am I here?&#34; Where did I come from?&#34; and &#34;What does the future hold?&#34; Do you have questions about God and faith, life and death, the present and the future? At some point in our lives, we all grapple with those questions and many others. If God is so good, why is the world so full of suffering? How can I live forever? What do Revelation&#39;s prophecies mean? What happens after we die? What does Bible prophecy predict about the end of the world? Rather than opinions or sermons, What the Bible Says About is especially designed to give you answers directly from Scripture. If you have never studied the Bible before, you will be amazed at how clear and powerful it is. Even if you have opened its pages many times, you may still be surprised at how clearly the Bible speaks on topics often ignored. With this study guide, what the Bible says will be more understandable. Allow God&#39;s Word to answer your deepest questions and speak to your heart&#39;s deepest needs.</p><p></p><h2>Miracles: Healing for a Broken World</h2><p>Father Stefan Starzynski reminds us through his personal experience and real stories that God is ever present, and that miracles are among the gifts offered to those who petition Him in faith.

It was only natural that man, after gazing at such scenic wonders, would turn some of the mystery he felt into legend. Sometimes these legends attempted to explain natural phenomena, sometimes they attempted to explain an occurrence that appeared to be supernatural, and sometimes they grew up around the eccentric characters that were drawn to the isolation of these mysterious hills. This collection of eighteen stories presents some of the mystery and awe that the mountains convey, and it may alter your perception of the Blue Ridge and Smoky Mountains forever. You may never stand atop Roan Mountain during a storm without thinking you hear a ghostly choir. You may gaze at the top of Chimney Rock during a hazy summer afternoon and wonder if it really is a ghostly cavalry fight you see. If you spend the night near High Hampton, you may find yourself listening for the call of the lonesome white owl. If you stand at Wiseman's View, you will probably think that you, too, can see the Brown Mountain Lights. Standing atop Clingman's Dome, you may wonder if there really is an enchanted lake where animals flock to heal their wounds somewhere in the valley below. And you will always wonder if the fly you hear on your mountain walk means that Spearfinger is lurking nearby.</p> <p>For several years, folklorists Randy Russell and Janet Barnett have taught a course about Southern folklore at the North Carolina Center for Advancement of Teaching in Cullowhee, North Carolina.

Pythian Odes (Loeb Classical Library) (English and Greek Edition)</h2><p><p>Of the Greek lyric poets, Pindar (ca. 518-438 BCE) was "by far the greatest for the magnificence of his inspiration" in Quintilian's view; Horace judged him "sure to win Apollo's laurels." The esteem of the ancients may help explain why a good portion of his work was carefully preserved. Most of the Greek lyric poets come down to us only in bits and pieces, but nearly a quarter of Pindar's poems survive complete. William H. Race now brings us, in two volumes, a new edition and translation of the four books of victory odes, along with surviving fragments of Pindar's other poems.</p><br><br><p>Like Simonides and Bacchylides, Pindar wrote elaborate odes in honor of prize-winning athletes for public performance by singers, dancers, and musicians. His forty-five victory odes celebrate triumphs in athletic contests at the four great Panhellenic festivals: the Olympic, Pythian (at Delphi), Nemean, and Isthmian games. In these complex poems, Pindar commemorates the achievement of athletes and powerful rulers against the backdrop of divine favor, human failure, heroic legend, and the moral ideals of aristocratic Greek society. Readers have long savored them for their rich poetic language and imagery, moral maxims, and vivid portrayals of sacred myths.</p><br><br><p>Race provides brief introductions to each ode and full explanatory footnotes, offering the reader invaluable guidance to these often difficult poems. His new Loeb Pindar also contains a helpfully annotated edition and translation of significant fragments, including hymns, paeans, dithyrambs, maiden songs, and dirges.</p></p><p><p>William H.

If they profess a disinclination for it, I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person.&#x2019;</p><p>Humble and lowly, a young Fanny Price goes to live with her wealthy Aunt and Uncle at their grand house, Mansfield Park. Growing up with her privileged and spoilt cousins, the Bertrams, she lives in the shadows of their glamorous lives, but manages to find an ally in her cousin, Edmund.</p><p>When Henry and Mary Crawford come to visit, the house is thrown into disarray as romance flourishes between the young people, leading Fanny to finally confront the extent of her true feelings for Edmund.</p></p><p>Though Jane Austen was writing at a time when Gothic potboilers such as Ann Ward Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> and Horace Walpole's <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> were all the rage, she never got carried away by romance in her own novels. In Austen's ordered world, the passions that ruled Gothic fiction would be horridly out of place; marriage was, first and foremost, a contract, the bedrock of polite society. Certain rules applied to who was eligible and who was not, how one courted and married and what one expected afterwards. To flout these rules was to tear at the basic fabric of society, and the consequences could be terrible. Each of the six novels she completed in her lifetime are, in effect, comic cautionary tales that end happily for those characters who play by the rules and badly for those who don't. In <i>Mansfield Park</i>, for example, Austen gives us Fanny Price, a poor young woman who has grown up in her wealthy relatives' household without ever being accepted as an equal. The only one who has truly been kind to Fanny is Edmund Bertram, the younger of the family's two sons. <p> Into this Cinderella existence comes Henry Crawford and his sister, Mary, who are visiting relatives in the neighborhood. Soon Mansfield Park is given over to all kinds of gaiety, including a daring interlude spent dabbling in theatricals. Young Edmund is smitten with Mary, and Henry Crawford woos Fanny. Yet these two charming, gifted, and attractive siblings gradually reveal themselves to be lacking in one essential Austenian quality: principle. Without good principles to temper passion, the results can be disastrous, and indeed, <i>Mansfield Park</i> is rife with adultery, betrayal, social ruin, and ruptured friendships. But this <i>is</i> a comedy, after all, so there is also a requisite happy ending and plenty of Austen's patented gentle satire along the way. Describing the switch in Edmund's affections from Mary to Fanny, she writes: "I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that everyone may be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in different people." What does <i>not</i> vary is the pleasure with which new generations come to Jane Austen. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>In recent years, Mansfield Park has come to be regarded as Austen&#39;s most controversial novel. It was published in two editions in her lifetime and here the differences between the first edition and the second, including some important amendments made by Jane Austen herself, are clearly noted on the page. The volume provides comprehensive notes, an extensive critical introduction covering the context and publication history of the work, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual appa ratus. This edition is indispensable for all serious scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>The Last Knight: The Art, Armor, and Ambition of Maximilian I</h2><p><b>A detailed look at the ambition&nbsp;and artistic legacy of Emperor Maximilian I and his passion for armor and chivalry</b><br><br> Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I (1459&#x2013;1519) crafted a public persona and personal mythology that earned him the romantic sobriquet the &#x201c;Last Knight&#x201d; and that perpetuates his legend to this day. In his lifelong quest to establish himself as Europe&#x2019;s noblest ruler, he commissioned art, epics, and lineages, as well as exceptional armor from the most celebrated armorers in Europe. Published to coincide with the 500th anniversary of his death, this book&nbsp;discusses the ramifications of Maximilian&#x2019;s wide-ranging political aspirations and artistic legacy&nbsp;and is the first to concentrate on the importance of armor and concepts of chivalry in the construction of his identity.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Maximilian established the prominence of the Habsburgs through advantageous alliances, expanding their dominions across Europe and into the New World. He commissioned grandiose projects, some of which rank among the most ambitious in European history. But more than this, he created a profile for the ruler&#x2014;a combination of idealism and vainglory&#x2014;that not only helped shape the identity of the growing German nation but also has resonances in the current political climate worldwide. This superb volume provides a rare picture of how art, armor, and the cult of personality helped shape the politics of Europe at the dawn of the Renaissance.</p><p>Featuring armor, weapons, prints, drawings, paintings, sculptures, tapestries, and military standards, this book looks at masterworks commissioned by Emperor Maximilian I and the role they played in shaping his identity and reputation.<b>Pierre Terjanian </b>is Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Curator in Charge of Arms and Armor at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Life Under Compulsion: Ten Ways to Destroy the Humanity of Your Child</h2><p><p><b>Welcome to Life Under Compulsion</b></p><p><i>&#x201c;Esolen [stands] in the top rank of authors of cultural criticism.&#x201d; &#x2014;</i>American Spectator</p><p>How do you raise a child who can sit with a good book and read?

And now Anthony Esolen provides the answers in this wise new book, the eagerly anticipated follow-up to his acclaimed <i>Ten Ways to Destroy the Imagination of Your Child</i>.</p><p>Esolen reveals that our children are becoming slaves to compulsions. Some compulsions come <i>from without</i>: government mandates that determine what children are taught, how they are taught, and even what they can eat in school. Others come <i>from within</i>: the itches that must be scratched, the passions by which children (like the rest of us) can be mastered.</p><p>Common Core, smartphones, video games, sex ed, travel teams, Twitter, politicians, popular music, advertising, a world with more genders than there are flavors of ice cream&#x2014;these and many other aspects of contemporary life come under Esolen&#x2019;s sweeping gaze in <b><i>Life Under Compulsion</i></b>.</p><p>This elegantly written book restores lost wisdom about education, parenting, literature, music, art, philosophy, and leisure. Esolen shows why the common understanding of freedom&#x2014;as a permission slip to do as you please&#x2014;is narrow, misleading&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and dangerous. He draws on great thinkers of the Western tradition, from Aristotle and Cicero to Dante and Shakespeare to John Adams and C.&nbsp;S. Lewis, to remind us what human freedom <i>truly </i>means.</p><p><b><i>Life Under Compulsion </i></b>also restates the importance of concepts so often dismissed today: truth, beauty, goodness, love, faith, and virtue.

The original Wonder Woman was ahead of her time, advocating female superiority and the benefits of matriarchy in the 1940s. At the same time, her creator filled the comics with titillating bondage imagery, and Wonder Woman was tied up as often as she saved the world. In the 1950s, Wonder Woman begrudgingly continued her superheroic mission, wishing she could settle down with her boyfriend instead, all while continually hinting at hidden lesbian leanings. While other female characters stepped forward as women&#x2019;s lib took off in the late 1960s, Wonder Woman fell backwards, losing her superpowers and flitting from man to man. <i>Ms. </i>magazine and Lynda Carter restored Wonder Woman&#x2019;s feminist strength in the 1970s, turning her into a powerful symbol as her checkered past was quickly forgotten. Exploring this lost history adds new dimensions to the world&#x2019;s most beloved female character, and <i>Wonder Woman Unbound </i>delves into her comic book and its spin-offs as well as the myriad motivations of her creators to<i> </i>showcase the peculiar journey that led to Wonder Woman&#x2019;s iconic status.</p><br></p><p><b>Tim Hanley</b> is a comic book historian.

Cities, from trendy coastal areas to the nation&#x2019;s heartland, are seeing levels of growth beyond the wildest visions of only a few decades ago. But vast areas in the same cities house thousands of people living in poverty who see little or no new hope or opportunity. Even as cities revive, they are becoming more unequal and more segregated. What does this mean for these cities&#x2014;and the people who live in them?<br><br> In <i>The Divided City</i>, urban practitioner and scholar Alan Mallach shows us what has happened over the past 15 to 20 years in industrial cities like Pittsburgh, Detroit, Cleveland, and Baltimore, as they have undergone unprecedented, unexpected revival. He draws from his decades of experience working in America&#x2019;s cities, and pulls in insightful research and data, to spotlight these changes while placing them in their larger economic, social, and political context. Mallach explores the pervasive significance of race in American cities&nbsp;and looks closely at&nbsp;the successes and failures of city governments, nonprofit entities, and citizens as they have tried to address the challenges of change.<br><br><i>The Divided City</i> offers strategies to foster greater equality and opportunity. Mallach makes a compelling case that&nbsp;these strategies must be local in addition to being concrete and focusing on people&#x2019;s needs&#x2014;education, jobs, housing and quality of life. Change, he argues, will come city by city, not through national plans or utopian schemes.<br><br> This is the first book to provide a comprehensive, grounded picture of the transformation of America&#x2019;s older industrial cities. It is neither a dystopian narrative nor a one-sided "the cities are back"&nbsp;story, but a balanced picture rooted in the nitty-gritty reality of these cities. <i>The Divided City</i> is imperative for anyone who cares about cities and who wants to understand how to make today&#x2019;s&nbsp;urban revival work for everyone.&nbsp;</p></p><p>Alan Mallach is a senior fellow at the Center for Community Progress in Washington DC.

Whedbee took the opportunity to tell some of the Outer Banks stories he'd heard during his many summers at Nags Head. The station received such a volume of mail in praise of his tale-telling that he was invited to remain even after the man he was substituting for returned to the air. "He had a way of telling a story that really captured me," said one of the program's co-hosts. "Whether he was talking about a sunset, a ghost, or a shipwreck, I was there, living every minute of it." Word traveled as far as Winston-Salem, where John F. Blair proposed to Whedbee that he compile his stories in book form. Whedbee welcomed the challenge, though his expectations for the manuscript that became&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Outer Banks and Tar Heel Tidewater</em>&nbsp;were modest. "I wrote it out of a love for this region and the people whom I'd known all my life," he said. "I didn't think it would sell a hundred copies." From the very first sentence of the foreword, Whedbee stamped the collection with his inimitable style: "You are handed herewith a small pod or school of legends about various portions of that magical region known as the Outer Banks of North Carolina as well as stories from other sections of the broad bays, sounds, and estuaries that make up tidewater Tarheelia." The Lost Colony, Indians, Blackbeard, an albino porpoise that guided ships into harbor&#x2015;the tales in that volume form the core of Outer Banks folklore. Whedbee liked to tell people that his stories were of three kinds: those he knew to be true, those he believed to be true, and those he fabricated. But despite much prodding, he never revealed which were which.</p> <p><em>Legends of the Outer Banks</em>&nbsp;went through three printings in 1966, its first year. Demand for Whedbee's tales and the author's supply of good material were such that further volumes were inevitable.&nbsp;<em>The Flaming Ship of Ocracoke &amp; Other Tales of the Outer Banks</em>&nbsp;was published in 1971,&nbsp;<em>Outer Banks Mysteries &amp; Seaside Stories</em>&nbsp;in 1978,&nbsp;<em>Outer Banks Tales to Remember</em>&nbsp;in 1985, and <em>Blackbeard's Cup and Stories of the Outer Banks</em>&nbsp;in 1989.

He opens with a poem by the Greek poet Antipater of Sidon, naming the septet of "wondrous marvels," then the author states "Seven was a mystical number to ancient people, and each of these spectacular sights was a masterpiece of architecture, sculpture, or engineering, famous for its great size, beauty, grandeur, and perfection." Ironically, the oldest of these, the Great Pyramid at Giza, is also the only one still standing. To emphasize its enormity, Curlee paints an image of Napoleon standing on the ruins of another nearby pyramid; thus, readers view how the "huge pile of carefully cut and fitted stones" was constructed as well as a sense of scale. The author then proceeds, chronologically, through the other six wonders, responsibly discussing various archeological theories. He confirms, for instance, that the foundations of a ziggurat at King Nebuchadrezzar II's palace were uncovered, but that experts disagree about whether sufficient proof exists of the hanging gardens at Babylon. Curlee also takes subtle stands: although he sketches four "versions" of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, he expresses his own preference with his full-bleed portrait of the structure. The expanse of his ambitious subject does not allow the author to delve into the kinds of details allowed by his single-subject volumes, but he certainly whets readers' appetites with this well-researched introduction.

It&#x2019;s not realistic to maintain these levels of grace and charm around the clock, day in and day out, but it isn&#x2019;t a bad notion to have that ideal in our minds as a guide and at least to strive for that, not just at a black-tie event or a community barbeque, but everywhere&#x2014;at the office, on public transport, in an overcrowded shopping mall. For one thing, it&#x2019;s a good way to snap ourselves out of being grouch almighty or from acting like a sulky opera heroine whenever we find ourselves in situations that push our buttons, say in a traffic jam or dealing with a customer-service rep over the telephone.<br><br> I suppose every era has the same complaint (at least somewhere on the planet), but I have to say that in my lifetime, the world has never felt more uncivil or full of hatred, violence, and fear. The Middle East is a disaster; much of Africa is in strife; Europe is straining at the seams; the states of America feel about as united as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle spilled out of their box onto the floor; the World Wide Web is a perpetual warzone of differing opinions and standards of behaviour. Not&nbsp;that anyone ever said life was all roses, the world one giant, fragrant garden of justice and kindness. Evil is always with us, jerks always among us, and every era has its reasons for getting up in arms.<br><br> Thomas Hobbes famously wrote, &#x201c;No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death: and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.&#x201d; If you want to get depressed, it doesn&#x2019;t take much. It&#x2019;s overwhelming, too, because when the world is in so much trouble all at once, those of us who care can feel powerless and wonder how we can begin to try to fix it.<br><br> I&#x2019;m hoping that the answer is &#x201c;little by little.&#x201d; Our tiny, so-called insignificant daily acts&#x2014;helping someone across the street, watering a flower, making a good soup&#x2014;are cracks in the gloom that let in light. The more rays we allow through, perhaps the sooner the skies may clear. &#x201c;That best portion of a man&#x2019;s life, his little nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and love,&#x201d; as Wordsworth phrased it, is, at the end of the day, what&#x2019;s at the heart of hosting and making home.<br> These are the thoughts and actions that can flip the coin from hostility to hospitality side up.

She is also a professional lyricist and a licensed wild bird rehabilitator. She lives in Oklahoma with her husband, artist Larry Dixon, and their flock of parrots. She can be found at mercedeslackey.com.*Starred Review* Hunger, anger, and hatred are constants for young Vetch, rendered a brutally mistreated and overworked serf by the Tian conquest of his homeland. But everything improves when a Tian jouster requisitions Vetch to become the first serf ever to be a dragon boy. His training is intense, and his duty clear-cut: to tend his jouster, Ari, and his dragon, Kashet. He discovers that, because Ari himself had hatched Kashet, the dragon is different from others that have been captured live in the wild and must be drugged to be made tractable. Vetch finds he really likes and understands dragons, and soon he becomes the best dragon boy of all. He still harbors anger, however, toward the Tian invasion. Could he, perhaps, hatch a dragon, and then escape to help his people? In Vetch's world, Lackey gives us a wonderfully visualized society, similar in terrain, climate, religion, and the differing circumstances of slave, serf, and free person to ancient Egypt. Moreover, she fills the book with well-limned characterizations and convincing, detailed dragon lore to make up a whole in which Vetch's coming-of-age becomes an integral part.

It captures the essence of the spirited manifesto that switched on light bulbs in the heads of a generation of women and continues to exert profound influence on feminists today.</p><p>Simone de Beauvoir was born in Paris in 1908. In 1929 she became the youngest person ever to obtain the agr�gation in philosophy at the Sorbonne. After the war, she emerged as one of the leaders of the existentialist movement, working with Jean-Paul Sartre on <i>Les Temps Modernes</i>.<i> The Second Sex, </i>first published in 1949, has been translated into forty languages and become a landmark in the history of feminism. Beauvoir was the author of many other books, including the novel <i>The Mandarins</i>,<i> </i>which was awarded the Prix Goncourt. She died in 1986.I hesitated a long time before writing a book on woman. The subject is irritating, especially for women; and it is not new. Enough ink has flowed over the quarrel about feminism; it is now almost over: let&#x201d;s not talk about it any more. Yet it is still being talked about. And the volumes of idiocies churned out over this past century do not seem to have clarified the problem. Besides, is there a problem? And what is it? Are there even women? True, the theory of the eternal feminine still has its followers; they whisper, &#x201c;Even in Russia, <i>women </i>are still very much women&#x201d;; but other well-informed people&#x2014;and also at times those same ones&#x2014;lament, &#x201c;Woman is losing herself, woman is lost.&#x201d; It is hard to know any longer if women still exist, if they will always exist, if there should be women at all, what place they hold in this world, what place they should hold. &#x201c;Where are the women?&#x201d; asked a short-lived magazine recently. But first, what is a woman? &#x201c;<i>Tota mulier in utero</i>: she is a womb,&#x201d; some say. Yet speaking of certain women, the experts proclaim, &#x201c;They are not women&#x201d;, even though they have a uterus like the others. Everyone agrees there are females in the human species; today, as in the past, they make up about half of humanity; and yet we are told that &#x201c;femininity is in jeopardy&#x201d;; we are urged, &#x201c;Be women, stay women, become women.&#x201d; So not every female human being is necessarily a woman; she must take part in this mysterious and endangered reality known as femininity. Is femininity secreted by the ovaries? Is it enshrined in a Platonic heaven? Is a frilly petticoat enough to bring it down to earth? Although some women zealously strive to embody it, the model has never been patented. It is typically described in vague and shimmering terms borrowed from a clairvoyant&#x2019;s vocabulary. In St Thomas&#x2019;s time it was an essence defined with as much certainty as the sedative quality of a poppy. But conceptualism has lost ground: biological and social sciences no longer believe there are immutably determined entities that define given characteristics like those of the woman, the Jew or the black; science considers characteristics as secondary reactions to a <i>situation. </i>If there is no such thing today as femininity, it is because there never was. Does the word &#x201c;woman, then, have no content? It is what advocates of Enlightenment philosophy, rationalism or nominalism vigorously assert: women are, among human beings, merely those who are arbitrarily designated by the word &#x201c;woman&#x201d;; American women in particular are inclined to think that woman as such no longer exists. If some backward individual still takes herself for a woman, her friends advise her to undergo psychoanalysis to get rid of this obsession. Referring to a book&#x2014;a very irritating one at that&#x2014;<i>Modern Woman: The Lost Sex, </i>Dorothy Parker wrote: &#x201c;I cannot be fair about books that treat women as women. My idea is that all of us, men as well as women, whoever we are, should be considered as human beings.&#x201d; But nominalism is a doctrine that falls a bit short; and it is easy for anti-feminists to show that women <i>are </i>not men. Certainly woman like man is a human being; but such an assertion is abstract; the fact is that every concrete human being is always uniquely situated. Rejecting the notions of the eternal feminine, the black soul or the Jewish character is not to deny that there are today Jews, blacks or women: this denial is not a liberation for those concerned, but an inauthentic flight. Clearly, no woman can claim without bad faith to be situated beyond her sex. A few years ago, a well-known woman writer refused to have her portrait appear in a series of photographs devoted specifically to women writers. She wanted to be included in the men&#x2019;s category; but to get this privilege, she used her husband&#x2019;s influence. Women who assert they are men still claim masculine consideration and respect. I also remember a young Trotskyite standing on a platform during a stormy meeting, about to come to blows in spite of her obvious fragility. She was denying her feminine frailty; but it was for the love of a militant man she wanted to be equal to. The defiant position that American women occupy proves they are haunted by the feeling of their own femininity. And the truth is that anyone can clearly see that humanity is split into two categories of individuals with manifestly different clothes, faces, bodies, smiles, movements, interests and occupations; these differences are perhaps superficial; perhaps they are destined to disappear. What is certain is that for the moment they exist in a strikingly obvious way.<br><br> If the female function is not enough to define woman, and if we also reject the explanation of the &#x201c;eternal feminine&#x201d;, but if we accept, even temporarily, that there are women on the earth, we then have to ask: what is a woman? <br><br> Merely stating the problem suggests an immediate answer to me. It is significant that I pose it. It would never occur to a man to write a book on the singular situation of males in humanity. If I want to define myself, I first have to say, &#x201c;I am a woman&#x201d;; all other assertions will arise from this basic truth.</p><h2>Grossology and You: Really Gross Things About Your Body</h2><p>We have news for you: You are gross.

Though Dakota is named in the title, the limited action could take place in any of the Plains states or in any long valleys of the West. Himler's sketches are realistic with a touch of ethereal nostalgia; they give substance to the verse-by-verse account of a young wife's prairie life in the last century. Because of vocabulary and concepts, this picture book is more for older readers than for children. The jacket blurb states that "A woman tells her granddaughter" about life of long ago; however, neither Turner nor Himler even hints at a prairie baby.

From the contemporary perspective of a pluralistic world, the form of the encyclopedia may be particularly apt to represent such a vast body of material as is presented here: defying any linear historical account or master narrative, it invites the reader to construct his or her own readings of the material by establishing relationships between individual drawings.<br>&#x2015;From the foreword by Martino Stierli</p><p>Throughout history, across radically different movements in Western culture, the human figure appears and reappears, in multiple guises, to remind us, the observers, of architectural purpose and of our mutual position in the world....This encyclopedia has enlarged or reduced all figures to the same approximate scale. Meredith, Sample, and MOS have gathered them here in an unprecedented, intoxicating way, like being at a fabulous party.<br>&#x2015;From the afterword by&nbsp;Raymund Ryan</p><p>Architects draw buildings, and the buildings they draw are usually populated by representations of the human figure&#x2015;drawn, copied, collaged, or inserted&#x2015;most often to suggest scale. It is impossible to represent architecture without representing the human form. This book collects more than 1,000 scale figures by 250 architects but presents them in a completely unexpected way: it removes them from their architectural context, displaying them on the page, buildingless, giving them lives of their own. They are presented not thematically or chronologically but encyclopedically, alphabetically by architect (Aalto to Zumthor). In serendipitous juxtapositions, the autonomous human figures appear and reappear, displaying endless variations of architecturally rendered human forms.</p><p>Some architects' figures are casually srcawled; others are drawn carefully by hand or manipulated by Photoshop; some are collaged and pasted, others rendered in charcoal or watercolors. Leon Battista Alberti presents a trident-bearing god; the Ant Farm architecture group provides a naked John and Yoko; Archigram supplies its Air Hab Village with a photograph of a happy family. Without their architectural surroundings, the scale figures present themselves as architecture's refugees.

The story of how Lady Liberty was conceived, constructed and bestowed makes a compelling tale.... Mann takes the statue from Edouard Laboulaye's pie-in-the-sky proposal at a dinner party in 1865 to the massive opening ceremonies in 1886. Along the way, she highlights the techniques that sculptor Bartholdi used to scale up his ambitious model successfully and the long struggle against public indifference and skepticism on both sides of the Atlantic to fund both the monument itself and its base. Witschonke supplements an array of period photos and prints with full-page or larger painted reconstructions of Bartholdi's studio and workshop, of the statue's piecemeal creation and finally of the Lady herself, properly copper colored as she initially was, presiding over New York's crowded harbor. As she still does. It's not exactly an untold tale, but this new telling is worth the read. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2011-06-01)<br><br>This fascinating book outlines the dream of Edouard Laboulaye and Frederic Auguste Bartholdi to honor their American friends.... The book is well researched and details the efforts that went into building the statue and bringing her to New York Harbor.

Economists investigate the workings of markets and tend to set ethical questions aside. Theologians, anxious to take up concerns raised by market outcomes, often dismiss economics and lose insights into the influence of market incentives on individual behavior. Mary L. Hirschfeld, who was a professor of economics for fifteen years before training as a theologian, seeks to bridge these two fields in this innovative work about economics and the thought of St. Thomas Aquinas.</p><p>According to Hirschfeld, an economics rooted in Thomistic thought integrates many of the insights of economists with a larger view of the good life, and gives us critical purchase on the ethical shortcomings of modern capitalism. In a Thomistic approach, she writes, ethics and economics cannot be reconciled if we begin with narrow questions about fair wages or the acceptability of usury. Rather, we must begin with an understanding of how economic life serves human happiness. The key point is that material wealth is an instrumental good, valuable only to the extent that it allows people to flourish. Hirschfeld uses that insight to develop an account of a genuinely humane economy in which pragmatic and material concerns matter but the pursuit of wealth for its own sake is not the ultimate goal.</p><p>The Thomistic economics that Hirschfeld outlines is thus capable of dealing with our culture as it is, while still offering direction about how we might make the economy better serve the human good.</p></p><p>Mary L. Hirschfeld is Associate Professor of Economics and Theology in the Department of the Humanities, Villanova University.&#x201c;For those seeking succinct, clear and accurate accounts of the Thomist understanding of the human person and the presuppositions of economics, this book could hardly be bettered.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Frank Litton</b><b>, </b><b><i>Irish Catholic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Hirschfeld] integrates economic research into a &#x2018;philosophic and theological discussion about the human good and human happiness.&#x2019; This knowledge may not be quantified in pie charts, by Wall Street, or within algorithms, but Hirschfeld insists that wisdom lies beyond the labs and the think-tanks...<i>Aquinas and the Market</i> begins a necessary conversation between economic and theological sectors, in the academy and, one hopes, outside the ivory towers and seminaries, to calculate our ultimate worth.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John L. Murphy</b><b>, </b><b><i>PopMatters</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Excellent...Hirschfeld offers an attractive and sophisticated model for how theology should approach economics.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Derek S. Jeffreys</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of the American Academy of Religion</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;We are not lacking in Christian critiques of neoclassical economics. Rarely do these come from a Harvard-trained economist turned Catholic theologian. In order to diagnose just how the rational choice model frustrates, rather than facilitates, the pursuit of happiness, we must get clear on the nature of genuine human flourishing. In a book both acute and winsome, pragmatic and visionary, Hirschfeld turns to Thomas Aquinas for inspiration. Only with an adequate anthropology in hand can we understand both why economic analysis works as well as it does, and why it ultimately leads us astray. Freed from the pursuit of maximal utility, we can begin to build a humane economy. A wise and urgently-needed contribution!&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jennifer Herdt, Yale University</b><br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Aquinas and the Market</i>, Mary Hirschfeld takes on the demanding task of relating religion&#x2015;particularly Christianity&#x2015;and the discipline of economics. Uniquely qualified, she accomplishes the task with insight and elegance. The book is well-written, timely, and a &#x2018;must-read&#x2019; for both scholars and students interested in the relation of faith and economics.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Daniel Finn, Saint John&#x2019;s University</b><br><br>&#x201c;While most theological reflections and critiques of the economy are often sorely deficient in economic understanding, <i>Aquinas and the Market</i> fills this void, offering careful analysis of the moral thought of Aquinas and its relevance to economics. Hirschfeld writes with clarity, providing a foundation upon which to better understand Aquinas&#x2019;s project on its own terms.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andrew Yuengert, Pepperdine University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Hirschfeld shows that the rational choice model of economists is too weak to make coherent sense of human well-being, even in matters economic. She proposes that we take the best insights of the economists and embed them in a more comprehensive account of practical reason, such as that of Thomas Aquinas. This kind of thought experiment is long overdue.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Russell Hittinger, University of Tulsa</b></p><h2>Moby-Dick in Pictures: One Drawing for Every Page</h2><p><p><strong>A collection of illustrations inspired by lines from every single page of the 552-page Signet Classics paperback edition of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick</strong></p> Inspired by one of the world&#x2019;s greatest novels, Ohio artist Matt Kish set out on an epic voyage of his own one day in August 2009. More than one hundred and fifty years following the original publication of Moby-Dick, Kish began illustrating Herman Melville&#x2019;s classic, creating images based on text selected from every page of the 552-page Signet Classics paperback edition. Completely self-taught, Kish refused to set any boundaries for the artwork and employed a deliberately low-tech approach in response to the increasing popularity of born-digital art and literature. He used found pages torn from old, discarded books, as well as a variety of mediums, including ballpoint pen, marker, paint, crayon, ink, and watercolor. By layering images on top of existing words and images, Kish has crafted a visual masterpiece that echoes the layers of meaning in Melville&#x2019;s narrative. In retrospect, Kish says he feels as foolhardy as Ishmael, the novel&#x2019;s narrator, and as obsessed as Captain Ahab in his quest for the great white whale. &#x201c;I see now that the project was an attempt to fully understand this magnificent novel, to walk through every sun-drenched word, to lift up all the hatches and open all the barrels, to smell, taste, hear, and see every seabird, every shark, every sailor, every harpooner, and every whale,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;It was a hard thing, a very painful thing, but the novel now lives inside me in a away it never could have before.&#x201d; Kish spent nearly every day for eighteen months toiling away in a small closet he converted into an art studio. In order to share the work with family and friends, he started the blog &#x201c;One Drawing for Every page of Moby-Dick,&#x201d; where he posted art and brief description about his process on a daily basis.</p><p>Matt Kish was born in 1969 and lives in the middle of Ohio. After stints as a cafeteria cook, a hospital registrar, a bookstore manager, and an English teacher, he ended up as a librarian. He draws as often as he can, often with whatever he can find. He has tried his hand at 35mm black-and-white photography (with real film and real chemicals), making comics and zines, a bit of collage, and lots of pen and ink. Moby-Dick is his favorite novel.Not so much honored as reimagined, Moby-Dick in Kish's hands is the vertiginous immersive experience Melville intended.&#x201d;<br> <i>Bookforum</i><br><br> In an age of soulless, cookie-cutter computer illustrations, Matt Kish's intense and obsessive drawings, paintings, and montages are a riotous delight. Kish's artwork renews our age-old love of expressive handmade imagery. He humanizes his material in way that has all but disappeared from the design scene. It's great to see that passion again.&#x201d;<br> Paula Scher, Pentagram<br><br> [A] wondrous compendium . . . sometimes vibrant, sometimes somber, Kish&#x2019;s images are relentlessly fresh and eye-catching . . . Even the least visual readers will feel energized by Kish&#x2019;s artistry and his obvious passion for Melville&#x2019;s work.&#x201d;<br> <i>Library Journal</i><br><br>"Conjuring the frenetic energy of tempest-tossed waves so integral to <i>Moby-Dick</i>'s setting, the artist's bold, full-page drawings in highly saturated colors illustrate passages he's called out, but also extend the narrative to suggest that modern-day man hungers to fulfill his self-proclaimed destiny every bit as much as the legendary whalers did....clearly infused with an intense joy that only comes from following one's heart."<br> <i>ForeWord Book Reviews</i><br><br>"Woven of equal parts visual mastery and creative bravery, Moby-Dick in Pictures is a treasure in and of itself, one that not only pays homage to Melville, but also reimagines what it means to embark on a modern-day epic voyage of creative restlessness."<br> <i>The Atlantic</i><br><br>"Kish has done something really fascinating [in Moby-Dick in Pictures]. He has not only re-imagined Moby Dick for a modern audience.

Why didn&#39;t anyone before Harding think of responding to this question like this? It&#39;s so obvious, once you see it. Harding presents a new vision of our place in the universe that uses the scientific method of looking to see what is true. It turns out that the truth about ourselves is not only true but also very good, and breathtakingly beautiful. We live in a sacred, many-layered, living universe - or rather it lives in us. Though it was completed in 1950, this book is still ahead of its time. One day it will surely be widely recognised for its greatness: its all-encompassing vision, its originality and freshness, its depth of insight, its wide-ranging knowledge, the clarity and poetry of its language, its humanity. It is a world-view not dependent on local culture or religion, but on universally verifiable facts. It is also a world-view that respects our manifest differences whilst celebrating our underlying unity - the unity not just of oneself with other people but with all of life, indeed with the whole universe. Harding died in 2007 aged 97, leaving behind him an impressive body of work. He was a highly creative person who was passionate about - he was in love with - this living universe and the immortal treasure that abides at its centre - at our centre. &#34;A work of the highest genius.&#34; C. S. Lewis.</p><p>Douglas Harding (1909-2007) was a British philosopher who worked out a modern map of our place in the universe. Harding invented experiments for testing the view that at centre, at zero distance, you are different from your appearance at say ten feet. At zero distance you are &#39;space for the world&#39;. Harding&#39;s experiments mean you don&#39;t believe this, you test it for yourself. This insight corresponds with what all great mystics have said about who we really are.</p><h2>A Commentary on the Psalms: 42-89 (Kregel Exegetical Library)</h2><p>Pastors, teachers, and all serious students of the Bible will find this commentary invaluable for developing their understanding of the Psalms and for improving their ability to expound it with precision and depth.</p><p><p><strong>Allen P.

In his famous spiritual classic,&nbsp;<i>The Imitation of Christ</i>, Thomas a Kempis reminds the reader that in order to become a follower of Christ one must imitate his life, and to accomplish this he adds: "Let it then be our main concern to meditate on the life of Jesus Christ. It is impossible to imitate Christ without first knowing him, and the best way of getting to know him is by meditating on his life as it is described in the four Gospels."<br><br> Thus, in this wonderful meditation book, perfect for Lent, or any time of the year, the great spiritual writer and monk gives profound, short reflections on Gospel passages about the passion and death of Christ. Each chapter, focusing on a specific aspect of the Passion of Our Lord, gives a prayer, a meditation and spiritual advice and closes with another short prayer.<br><br> Very much in the same style as his&nbsp;<i>The Imitation of Christ</i>, this book covers the entire Passion, and makes great spiritual reading for anyone.&nbsp;<b>Illustrated.</b></p><p>Available for the first time in modern English, this new translation of � Kempis&#39; classic is a long-awaited gem. Jesuit scholar Fr. Joseph Tylenda, who has previously published translations of authors such as Ignatius of Loyola, provides a concise and readable book that will complement the Gospel accounts of Christ&#39;s passion.<b>Thomas � Kempis</b>&nbsp;(1379-1471) was born in Germany and schooled by the Order of Brothers and Sisters of the Common Life in Netherlands. He lived for seventy years among the Canons Regular of St. Augustine at Mount St. Agnes Monastery.

He doesn&#39;t know that the ultimate target of this mission is himself.</p><p>Rancorous political infighting surrounds the selection of a successor to the dying head of the CIA just as Mitch Rapp, the agency's top operative, embarks on a dangerous mission to take out a well-known German industrialist believed to be supplying Middle East terrorists with highly sensitive equipment critical to constructing a nuclear bomb. When Rapp's ultimately successful mission is compromised from within, ailing CIA director Thomas Stansfield puts his imprimatur on the efforts of his chosen successor, Irene Kennedy, director of the agency's Counterterrorism Center, to identify the powerful interests both inside and outside the agency that wanted Rapp to fail. <p> The motive soon becomes clear; there are people who'll stop at nothing to remove Kennedy from the helm of the agency after Stansfield dies. One thing they didn't count on was Rapp's survival, and now he's a lethal weapon whose sights are fixed directly on the most powerful among them. This is a strong, swift thriller, a bit predictable (the senator in the black hat has dogs named Caesar and Brutus) but nonetheless involving. Author Vince Flynn sustains the dramatic tension from the opening paragraph to the last; in Mitch Rapp, he's got the makings of a promising series hero. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Vince Flynn&#39;s fifteen thrillers have been published in twenty countries.

He started his career as a police reporter and true crime magazine editor, and turned those experiences toward fiction writing with his first novel, The Snatchers, in 1953, about a failed kidnapping. He wrote more than 35 books, many of them translated into different languages and turned into films like The Night of the Following Day, The Money Trap, The Big Caper, Pierrot le Fou and perhaps most famously, The Killing, adapted by Stanley Kubrick from White s novel, Clean Break. He was considered the master of the big caper, and was credited by director Quentin Tarantino with the inspiration for his film, Reservoir Dogs.

While their loved ones waited in unbearable tension on shore, their ultimate fate would depend upon one man, U.S. Navy officer Charles "Swede" Momsen -- an extraordinary combination of visionary, scientist, and man of action. In this thrilling true narrative, prize-winning author Peter Maas brings us in the vivid detail a moment-by-moment account of the disaster and the man at its center. Could he actually pluck those men from a watery grave? Or had all his pioneering work been in vain?</p></p><p>May 23, 1939. Television was being advertised for the first time to American consumers. Europe was on the brink of war as Hitler and Mussolini signed an alliance in Berlin. These were the days before sonar and before the discovery of nuclear power revolutionized submarine design. Dependent on battery power, submarines were actually surface ships that "occasionally dipped beneath the waves." If a sub went down, "every man on board was doomed. It was accepted that there would be no deliverance." <p>Swede Momsen was, according to master storyteller Peter Maas, the "greatest submariner the Navy ever had," and he was determined to beat those odds. Momsen spent his career trying to save the lives of trapped submariners, despite an indifferent Navy bureaucracy that thwarted and belittled his efforts at every turn. Every way of saving a sailor entombed in a sub--"smoke bombs, telephone marker buoys, new deep-sea diving techniques, escape hatches, artificial lungs, a great pear-shaped rescue chamber--was either a direct result of Momsen's inventive derring-do, or of value only because of it." Yet on the day the Squalus sank, none of Momsen's inventions had been used in an actual submarine disaster. </p><p> In <i>The Terrible Hours</i>, Maas reconstructs the harrowing 39 hours between the disappearance of the submarine Squalus during a test dive off the New England coast and the eventual rescue of 33 crew members trapped in the vessel 250 feet beneath the sea. It's also the story of Momsen's triumph. Under the worst possible circumstances, Momsen led a successful mission and helped change the future of undersea lifesaving. Not only has Maas written a carefully researched and suspenseful tribute to a true hero, in the process he has salvaged a long-forgotten, riveting piece of American history. <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p>7 cds</p><h2>Moon Zion &amp; Bryce: With Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Grand Staircase-Escalante &amp; Moab (Travel Guide)</h2><p><b>Explore the colorful hoodoos, canyons, and iconic arches of all five of Utah's national parks with <i>Moon Zion &amp; Bryce</i>.

The "parental unit" started a private investigation business when Dad retired from police work. His wife assists him and their two daughters, Isabel, (Izzy) a 30-year-old with a habit of being arrested, and Rae, a 15-year-old Cheetos-loving teen, would like to think that they help out in the family business. Especially where Izzy is concerned, this is a stretch. Brother David is a successful attorney who has nothing to do with the family enterprise. He has troubles of his own. <p> Izzy has been living in the apartment of a friend while he is away. When he returns unexpectedly, it quickly becomes clear that being roommates with an old, cigar-smoking, poker-playing, big drinker isn't going to work. Izzy moves home temporarily and then the fun begins. She decides that their new next door neighbor, John Brown, whose landscape gardening business she judges to be a cover, is somehow making women disappear. She gets herself invited to dinner, discovers a locked room, believes his name is phony, follows him everywhere, has a restraining order against her, and <i>still</i> she can't let it go. </p><p> Meanwhile, Rae has befriended a great guy, a cop named Henry Stone, who is almost too good to be true. The reader starts pulling for him and Izzy to get together right away, even though he doesn't deserve the aggravation. Lutz keeps the ball rolling faster and faster with David's problems, her parents' frequent vacations, which they refer to as "disappearances," and the fact that everyone in the family has secrets from one another. If there is any curse at work here, it is that all the family members are terminally nosy. What they discover about each other and the other players keeps you turning pages and hoping that Lutz is hard at work on the next installment of this zany family's misadventures. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Lisa Lutz is the author of the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling, Edgar Award&#x2013; and Macavity Award&#x2013;nominated, and Alex Award&#x2013;winning Spellman Files&nbsp;series, as well as the novels <i>How to Start a Fire</i>, <i>The Passenger</i>, and <i>The Swallows</i>.

Max is an inspirational figure, but he is also a flawed idealist whose vow to protect the Javanese from cruelty ends in his own downfall. In <i>Max Havelaar</i>, Multatuli (pseudonym for Eduard Douwes Dekker) vividly recreated his own experiences in Java and tellingly depicts the hypocrisy of those who gained from the corrupt coffee trade. Sending shockwaves through the Dutch nation when it was published in 1860, this damning expos� of the terrible conditions in the colonies led to welfare reforms in Java and continues to inspire the Fairtrade movement today. <br><br> Roy Edwards&#x2019;s vibrant translation conveys the satirical and innovative style of Multatuli&#x2019;s autobiographical polemic. In his introduction, R. P. Meijer discusses the author&#x2019;s tempestuous life and career, the controversy the novel aroused, and its unusual narrative structure.</p><p>When <i>Max Havelaar</i> was first published in Holland in 1860, it ignited a major political and social brouhaha. The novel, written by a former official of the Dutch East Indian Civil Service under the pen name Multatuli, exposed the massive corruption and cruelty rife in the Dutch colony of Java. <i>Max Havelaar</i> is an undeniably autobiographical novel; like his hero, Multatuli--the pseudonym for Eduard Douwes Dekker--was an Assistant Resident of Lebak in Java; like Havelaar in the novel, he resigned his position when his accusations of corruption and abuse were disregarded by higher authorities, resulting in years of poverty for both author and fictional hero. <i>Max Havelaar</i> is told from several different perspectives; the reader first meets an Amsterdam coffee dealer named Droogstoppel, a man so obsessed with coffee that his every thought and action is governed by it. Droogstoppel has come by a manuscript from an old schoolmate who, down on his luck, has asked him to get it published. The schoolmate is Havelaar, and the manuscript relates his experiences as an idealistic and generous young civil servant who tries to protect the poor and bring justice to the powerless. <p> The central part of the novel details conditions in Java, particularly Havelaar's efforts to correct injustices in the face of a corrupt government system. That his efforts will prove futile soon becomes apparent, and there is something almost Greek in the inevitability of Havelaar's declining fortunes. Despite its tragic themes, <i>Max Havelaar</i> is savagely funny, particularly the chapters narrated by Droogstoppel, a character unmatched for his veniality, narrow-mindedness, or singular lack of understanding or imagination. Though Multatuli's masterpiece is nearly 150 years old, it wears its age well, and Roy Edwards's excellent translation offers English-speaking readers a wonderful opportunity to experience one of the Netherlands's great literary classics.</p><b>Multatuli </b>(1820&#x2013;1887) was the pseudonym of Eduard Douwes Dekker. He was born in Amsterdam, the son of a Dutch sea captain. In 1838 he went to the Indies and joined the East Indian Civil Service. Despite being involved in various disputes with his superiors, his outstanding abilities were recognized and he rose steadily in rank. He married Everdine, Baroness van Wijnbergen, in 1846 and they had two children. Increasingly unable to accept the brutalities of colonial rule, he resigned from the service in 1856. Years of poverty followed, during which he wandered around Europe, struggling to survive by his writing and endeavoring to improve the situation of the Javanese. <i>Max Havelaar</i>, his powerful indictment of colonialism, was written during 1859 and caused a sensation in Holland when it was published in 1860. He spent his later years involved in political and economic polemics.<br><br> An Englishman by birth, <b>Roy Edwards</b> (translator; 1918&#x2013;1980) married a Dutch-speaking wife and settled in the Low Countries in his later years. During the 1950s and 1960s he translated the works of many of the Netherlands&#x2019; greatest authors and was awarded the prestigious Martinus Nijhoff Prize in 1962 for his translations from the Dutch. <br><br> <b>R. P. Meijer </b>(introduction; 1926&#x2013;1993) was born in the Netherlands and earned his first degree from the University of Amsterdam. For several years he taught at the University of Melbourne, and was Professor of Dutch Language and Literature at the University of London, first at Bedford College and later at University College, from 1971 until 1988. His publications include <i>Literature of the Low Countries </i>(1978), <i>Dutch Grammar and Reader </i>(with Jacob Smit, 1976) and <i>Post-war Dutch and Flemish Poetry </i>(1974).

She lives in Southern California.A very unusual and intriguing book. It's not a series of projects, although patterns and guidelines for making five quilts - including the swan shown on the front cover - have been included. This is more a primer on the method that Grace and Meredith use to plan their work before starting to actually cut or sew fabric. Their very strong emphasis is on value and they take a highly analytical, almost mathematical approach that we believe will appeal to quiltmakers who feel most comfortable with plans, structure and precision. We might have expected working in this way would lead to exacting geometric quilts, but Grace and Meredith's quilts are quite "painterly" landscapes and animal portraits that are absolutely stuffing. <br>--Australian Homespun; no.108 vol.13 no.5<br><br>Would you like to discover what the secret is to a show-stopping art quilt? If so, read on! Setting out to make a quilt is like embarking on a journey; filled with unexpected surprises, some frustration and, hopefully a really satisfying end product. To quote the chinese proverb of Lao-tzu 'A journey of a thousand miles beings with one little step' and this book encourages you to join the journey and take pleasure in a piece of work that reflects your visions and dreams. There are 5 projects with full-size patterns featuring three appliqu� styles: turned edge, raw edge and free edge, so you can choose the method of appliqu� that you are most comfortable with. One of the most interesting elements of this book, for me, is the instruction on how valie creates a focal point, develops dimension and lends a painterly effect to your quilt.

Pierpont Morgan, sugar king H. O. Havemeyer, Boston aesthete Isabella Stewart Gardner, and industrialist Henry Clay Frick. Packed with stunning reproductions, this is an ideal gift book for art lovers and history buffs alike.</p><p>A former reporter for <b>Forbes</b> and <b>The Wall Street Journal</b>, Cynthia Saltzman earned degrees in art history at Harvard and Berkeley. She currently resides with her family in Brooklyn, New York.In this vividly narrated and highly informative study, Saltzman (<i>The Portrait of Dr. Gachet</i>), a former reporter for <i>Forbes</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, examines American collectors like Henry Clay Frick and J. Pierpont Morgan who developed America's great Old Master collections, like those at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Banker and railroad magnate Henry Marquand gave 50 Old Masters to the Met, among them Vermeer's <i>Young Woman with a Water Pitcher</i>. Marquand believed in the museum's capacity to educate the public, while Gardner and Morgan modeled themselves after Renaissance patrons. A Gainsborough and Raphael were among Morgan's cultural conquests in a vast, encyclopedic collecting project. Gardner's passion for Italian Renaissance art and her complicated relationship with Renaissance specialist Bernard Berenson, who arranged for the acquisition of the most important work in her collection, Titian's <i>Rape of Europa</i>, is one of the book's highlights. Saltzman deftly demonstrates that the often highly competitive process and volatile acquisition of cultural capital by dealers and their eager employers gives fascinating and important insight into the often fraught fusion of culture and commodity that built world-class American collections.

British naval aggression made it clear that the ocean would be the war's primary battlefield-but America's navy, only twenty ships strong, faced a practiced British fleet of more than a thousand men-of-war. Still, through a combination of nautical deftness and sheer bravado, a handful of heroic captains and their stalwart crews managed to turn the tide of the war, besting the haughty skippers of the mighty Royal Navy and cementing America's newly won independence. In <i>1812: The Navy's War</i>, award-winning naval historian George C. Daughan draws on a wealth of archival research to tell the amazing story of this tiny, battletested team of Americans and their improbable yet pivotal victories. Daughan thrillingly details the pitched naval battles that shaped the war, and shows how these clashes proved the navy's vital role in preserving the nation's interests and independence. A stunning contribution to military and national history, <i>1812: The Navy's War </i>is the first complete account in more than a century of how the U.S. Navy rescued the fledgling nation and secured America's future.</p><p><b>George C. Daughan </b>holds a Ph.D. in American History and Government from Harvard University. Author of <i>If By Sea </i>and <i>1812: The Navy's War</i>, Daughan lives in Portland, Maine."The fledgling U.S. Navy had advantages that would surprise, infuriate and ultimately impress the British, as renowned naval military historian George C. Daughan wonderfully illustrates in his new work, <i>1812: The Navy's War</i>.... Daughan's love of the sea and naval history is infectious.... Those who are familiar with C.S. Forester's Hornblower tales or Patrick O' Brian's stories of Captain Jack Aubrey will enjoy this narrative of the American side of the Napoleonic wars and thrill to the progress of an underdog along the route to world power."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>American Spirit</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[<i>1812</i>] should become a standard text for the serious history student.... This book will do well to remind us, in times of danger and uncertainty, of how welcome a bulwark is a powerful navy."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Roanoke Times</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Mr. Daughan shows how the war at sea fitted into the American war effort and how the Navy--and the country--came out of the war better for the experience.... Mr. Daughan suggests that the War of 1812 was indeed a second war of independence, completing what had been started in 1775, strengthening the nation's democratic principles, and establishing a new and positive relationship in which Britain recognized America's place in the world."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[A] compelling sequel to his award-winning <i>If By Sea</i>.... Daughan offers a rousing retelling of the war, strongly recommended for general readers, high school students, and lower classmen."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Library Journal</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[A] richly detailed, well-documented, and compelling account.... Daughan's is a history that expands our understanding, debunking several popular myths.... In the end, this history of an oft-forgotten war holds value for all.... Readers who have been eagerly awaiting the bicentennial will find in Daughan's <i>1812</i> an account that confirms why the conflict merits remembrance--and celebration."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>1812: The Navy's War </i>is an important, well-researched and timely book--next year marks the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812--which scholars and lay persons alike will enjoy for its descriptions of the battles and Daughan's analysis of the domestic and international dimensions of the war."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[Daughan] has written a concise, invaluable history of the War of 1812, placing it in context and making it accessible for modern readers.

She worked at several restaurants in New York and Connecticut before relocating to San Francisco in 2007. Once in the Bay Area, Simone worked as a personal chef while working to launch a catering company. Shortly after getting Zenbelly off the ground, she learned what was behind her constant headaches and lethargy: a pretty serious sensitivity to gluten. Discovering that she had food allergies put the brakes on her business, but only long enough for her to pivot. She couldn&#39;t imagine serving people food she hasn&#39;t tasted and recognized the tremendous need for gluten-free catering. And who better to do it than someone who couldn&#39;t imagine living a life restricted by food allergies? Simone is a chef on a mission: to prove that gluten-free and Paleo cuisine can be just as gourmet, refined, and artfully presented as what can be found in a fine bistro. She draws on her holistic nutrition education to bring true nourishment to her cooking and belies the notion that healthy food can&#39;t be delicious enough to impress the most serious gourmand. She offers a chef&#39;s perspective to Paleo recipes on her blog, Zenbelly.com. There, she shares her grain-free recipes that have made believers out of some of the most die-hard gluten eaters and has encouraged countless people to roll up their sleeves and have fun creating simple, delicious, healthy food.Soups and stews are not only delicious and convenient, they are nourishing and nutrient-dense.

Forester&#x2019;s 1936 masterpiece follows Lt General Herbert Curzon, who fumbled a fortuitous early step on the path to glory in the Boer War. 1914 finds him an honourable, decent, brave and wholly unimaginative colonel. Survival through the early slaughters in which so many fellow-officers perished then brings him rapid promotion. By 1916, he is a general in command of 100,000 British soldiers, whom he leads through the horrors of the Somme and Passchendaele, a position for which he is entirely unsuited and intellectually unprepared.</p><p>Wonderfully human with Forester&#x2019;s droll relish for human folly on full display, this is the story of a man of his time who is anything but wicked, yet presides over appalling sacrifice and tragedy. In his awkwardness and his marriage to a Duke&#x2019;s unlovely, unhappy daughter, Curzon embodies Forester&#x2019;s full powers as a storyteller. His half-hero is patriotic, diligent, even courageous, driven by his sense of duty and refusal to yield to difficulties. But also powerfully damned is the same spirit which caused a hundred real-life British generals to serve as high priests at the bloodiest human sacrifice in the nation&#x2019;s history. A masterful and insightful study about the perils of hubris and unquestioning duty in leadership, <em>The General</em> is a fable for our times.</p></p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettes<p>C. S.

He dominated the Roman courts, usually appearing for the defense. His speeches are masterpieces of persuasion. They are compellingly written, emotionally powerful, and sometimes hilariously funny. This book presents five of his most famous defenses: of Roscius, falsely accused of murdering his father; of the consul-elect Murena, accused of electoral bribery; of the poet Archias, on a citizenship charge; of Caelius, ex-lover of Clodia Metelli, on charges of violence; and of Milo, for murdering Cicero's hated enemy Clodius. Cicero's clients were rarely innocent; but so seductive is his oratory that the reader cannot help taking his side. In these speeches we are plunged into some of the most exciting courtroom dramas of all time. These new translations preserve Cicero's literary artistry and emotional force, while achieving new standards of accuracy. Each speech has its own introduction, and a general introduction discusses Cicero's public career and the criminal courts. The substantial explanatory notes smoothly guide the reader through the speeches, allowing a clearer understanding of the text.<br></p><p>Lecturer in Classics at the University of Leeds.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>The Passions of the Soul and Other Late Philosophical Writings (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><strong>'Those most capable of being moved by passion are those capable of tasting the most sweetness in this life.'</strong><br><br>Descartes is most often thought of as introducing a total separation of mind and body.

Although they seem tough (&#34;Don&#39;t talk to a man first&#34;), they will teach you how to accept occasional defeat and move on. And although they require discipline (&#34;No more than casual kissing on the first date&#34;), they will bring out the best in you and in the men you date. The goal?

In <i>The Age of Edison</i>, award-winning author and historian Ernest Freeberg weaves a narrative that reaches from Coney Island and Broadway to the tiniest towns of rural America, tracing the progress of electric light through the reactions of everyone who saw it and capturing the wonder Edison&#x2019;s invention inspired. It is a quintessentially American story of ingenuity, ambition, and possibility in which the greater forces of progress and change are made by one of our most humble and ubiquitous objects.</p><p><b>Ernest Freeberg</b> is the author of <i>The Education of Laura Bridgman</i> and<i> Democracy&#x2019;s Prisoner</i>, which was a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize finalist. He is a distinguished professor of humanities at the University of Tennessee and lives in Knoxville, Tennessee."Mr. Freeberg's broad research adds up to a vivid social history with parallels for today's technology innovators and for those who wish to increase their number. It underscores the point that the work of Edison and other pioneers of light took place in an unusual setting, a period in which American invention was remarkably active and fertile... <i>The Age of Edison</i> comes at a fitting time, the close of the era of the incandescent light. When the old stocks of incandescents run out, it may be the end of pleasant illumination at a cheap price&#x2014;that is, until another Thomas Edison finds a way."<br>&#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;Freeberg takes us on a captivating intellectual adventure that offers long-forgotten stories of the birth pangs of the electrical age that are amusing, surprising and tragic.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2014;Washington Post</i><br><br>"One of the many pleasures of <i>Age of Edison</i>, Ernest Freeberg's engaging history of the spread of electricity throughout the United States, is that he captures the excitement and wonder of those early days, when 'a machine that could create enough cheap and powerful light to hold the night at bay' promised 'liberation from one of the primordial limits imposed by nature on the human will'... Freeberg's thoughtful and thought-provoking book quietly suggests that, to properly distribute and control such a powerful force, commercial initiative and a sense of civic responsibility were equally essential."<br>&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"A dynamo of a book powered by an infectious enthusiasm for the can-do spirit of Edison and rival geniuses racing to turn night into day.

Roger Ekirch, author of <i>At Day's Close: Night in Times Past</i><br><br>"Ernest Freeberg's fascinating account of the arrival and impact of electric lighting in America fills an important gap in the history of this subject.

Thousands of raiders on horseback, some of them Anglo-Americans, regularly crossed the river from Mexico to pillage, murder, and rape. Their main objective? To steal cattle, which they herded back across the Rio Grande to sell. Honest citizens found it almost impossible to live in the Nueces Strip.</p><p>In desperation, the governor of Texas called on an extraordinary man, Captain Leander M. McNelly, to take command of a Ranger company and stop these border bandits. One of McNelly's recruits for this task was George Durham, a Georgia farmboy in his teens when he joined the "Little McNellys," as the Captain's band called themselves. More than half a century later, it was George Durham, the last surviving "McNelly Ranger," who recounted the exciting tale of taming the Nueces Strip to San Antonio writer Clyde Wantland.</p><p>In Durham's account, those long-ago days are brought vividly back to life. Once again the daring McNelly leads his courageous band across Southwest Texas to victories against incredible odds. With a boldness that overcame their dismayingly small number, the McNellys succeeded in bringing law and order to the untamed Nueces Strip&#x2014;succeeded so well that they antagonized certain "upright" citizens who had been pocketing surreptitious dollars from the bandits' operations.</p></p><p>"...the reader seems to smell the acrid gunsmoke and to hear the creak of saddle leather."

A man came in, and everything he said was life-altering. <br><br> This is the unsettling and ultimately enlightening narrative of what happened that night. Strieber was never really sure who this strange and knowing visitor was--a "Master of Wisdom"? A figure from a different realm of consciousness? A preternaturally intelligent being? He called him the Master of the Key. The one thing of which Strieber was certain is that both the man and the encounter were real. <br><br> The main concern of the Master of the Key is to save each of us from self-imprisonment. "Mankind is trapped," the stranger tells Strieber. "I want to help you spring the trap." In a sweeping exchange between Strieber and the stranger--which takes the form of a classical student- teacher dialogue in pursuit of inner understanding--the unknown man presents a lesson in human potential, esoteric psychology, and man's fate. He illuminates why man has been caught in a cycle of repeat violence and self-destruction--and the slender, but very real, possibility for release. <br><br> In its breadth and intimacy, <i>The Key</i> is on par with contemporary metaphysical traditions, such as <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, or even with the dialogues of modern wisdom teachers, such as D.T. Suzuki and Carl Jung.</p><p><b>Whitley Strieber</b>&nbsp;is the internationally bestselling author of more than 20 novels and works of nonfiction, among them the landmark work <i>Communion</i>, his account of a close encounter of the third kind that took place in December 1985.

In this rapidly converging landscape, cyborg superagent Major Motoko Kusanagi is charged to track down the craftiest and most dangerous terrorists and cybercriminals, including &#x201c;ghost hackers&#x201d; who are capable of exploiting the human/machine interface and reprogramming humans to become puppets to carry out the hackers&#x2019; criminal ends.

In 1985, his first major work, oAppleseedo, was published by Seishinsha, without being serialized in or submitted to a manga magazine, which is quite rare in the Japanese manga publishing industry. Shortly thereafter, Shirow set up his own company, and besides working on his own manga and illustration work, took on projects from the anime and game industry. Shirow&#39;s work has been recognized and highly respected outside Japan. He has been active in numerous anime and game projects but it is rare for him to take the helm of such projects, or even to have his name used prominently. Shirow Masamune was born in Japan in Chuo Ward, Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture, on November 23rd, 1961.

Staring back at you is your new best friend, your steady companion. Say hello to fatigue. It has come to stay.<br><br>I was not a wife or a mother when I attended my twentieth high school reunion. I wafted into the Marriott ballroom that night, bright, shining, and weightless by the choices that had left me unencumbered at the age of thirty-eight. I looked fantastic, and more so by comparison to my classmates, I thought. Most of them were, naturally, raising families and toughing out difficult marriages. They wore every hard day's night on their faces, hair, and everywhere. An exuberant ex approached, sizing up my full effect. "What's your secret?" he gushed. I demurred. I was so deluded. I thought (a) there was a secret, and (b) I knew it.<br><br>Whatever I thought it was, I must have forgotten it between the 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. feedings. I must have misplaced it on one of those ten thousand nights when the fever goes up, the coughing gets worse, or the crying won't quit. I must have washed it with the whites or swept it up with the mud, crud, and cracker crumbs.<br><br>More so than the endless tasks and deprivations, it is something else that ultimately wears you down and out. It is the monumental responsibility of parenthood in general and motherhood in particular. It renders you so very tired that you begin to look and even sound like your own mother. I am too tired to pick you up. I am too tired to play. I am too tired to laugh. I am sick and tired.<br><br>A Zen teacher might exhort, "When you're tired, be tired." In other words, don't exaggerate, contemplate, bemoan, or otherwise involve yourself with it. Don't reject it; don't despise it. Don't inflate it with meaning or difficulty. Be what you are: be tired.<br><br>Exhaustion is not a strategic spot from which to defend your turf. It's not the best place to start drawing lines and setting limits. It's not a power position. And therein lies the extreme benevolence of it. Be tired. Be so tired that you will let the troubles and turmoil wash over you. Be so tired that you will stop measuring the length of your hardship and stop looking for an end. You will forego some things for a time&#x2014;bouncy hair, brilliant eyes, clear skin, incalculable dress sizes, good cheer, the intoxication of looking your best&#x2014;but you will lose nothing that is worth fighting for.<br><br>Fatigue is a gift. Like many of the gifts that come to mothers, it is not one you would choose, like a spa vacation, but one you can use, like a humidifier. It is a cure and a balm. Fatigue helps you forget. When you are tired, you let go. You drop what you no longer need and you do not pick it up again.</p><h2>Geraldine&#39;s Blanket</h2><p><p>Geraldine loves her baby blanket.

His first taste of fame followed the summer when he was 17 years old and left Paris with US$30, worked aboard a ship, disembarked in the United States and managed a 30,000-mile jaunt around North America. This adventure led to Lapierre&#39;s first best-selling book, A Dollar for a Thousand Miles. Since then, he has continuously searched for new messages and stories. While completing military service in 1954, Lapierre met an American soldier named Larry Collins. An everlasting friendship-and a valuable partnership-sprang from this meeting. Years later, they would collaborate on some of the century&#39;s most memorable books including Is Paris Burning?, which was made into a major motion picture boasting 30 international stars;...Or I&#39;ll Dress You in Mourning, O Jerusalem, Freedom at Midnight, The Fifth Horseman, books read by millions of readers in more than 30 languages. Lapierre&#39;s solo work have been equally impressive. His book Freely on the Soviet Roads was another best-seller, and he followed with Chessman Told Me, a book about the famous convict Caryl Chessman, who confessed to Lapierre before meeting his death at San Quentin. Lapierre&#39;s book, Beyond Love, a reconstruction of the discovery of the AIDS virus, was another world best-seller. In 1981, Lapierre founded a humanitarian association rescuing leper children from the slums of Calcutta, which is supported by half the royalties from his literary successes. Lapierre&#39;s time in Calcutta gave him still another best-seller, The City of Joy. This book, which was made into a major motion picture starring Patrick Swayze, has sold over seven million copies. It tells the epic survival story of the population of one of India&#39;s poorest slums. It was rewarded with the prestigious U.S. literary Christopher Award. While researching in Calcutta, Lapierre became a close associate of Mother Teresa who gave him the exclusive authorization to write a film on her life and the work of her sisters, the Missionaries of Charity. With Geraldine Chaplin playing the role of Mother Teresa, the film Mother Teresa-In the Name of God&#39;s Poor was aired, at prime time, on the Family Channel in the U.S. and several European channels. Lapierre&#39;s script has been nominated by the prestigious Humanitas Prize for communicating the best values. Lapierre&#39;s last book A Thousand Suns is currently a huge best-seller in Europe. It appeared in March 1999 in the U.S. With its royalties, the author has been able to expand his humanitarian action in India to eradicate tuberculosis in over 1,200 villages of the Ganges delta.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>On Meadowview Street</h2><p><p>Caroline lives on Meadowview Street.

The girl doesn&#39;t get far before she spies a beautiful, solitary flower on her own lawn. Caroline cordons off the bloom, creating a small wildflower preserve that expands as her thoughtful additions (a maple, bird feeders, a pond) allow nature to take root and thrive. The jab at soulless suburbia and its faux-bucolic trappings may be most appreciated by adults, but the crucial message (especially about the importance of green corridors, migration paths for birds and beasts) will speak strongly to today&#39;s ecologically aware children. And it&#39;s all done without stridency. Cole&#39;s understated watercolors match the tale&#39;s gentle tone, while still showcasing the satisfying contrast between the antiseptic tract houses and the riotous, organic tangle of Caroline&#39;s front-yard Eden. The artwork also hints at the metaphorical blossoming of the lonely newcomer as the growth of the garden both parallels and prompts new connections with neighborhood children. Similarities abound with Sarah Stewart&#39;s The Gardener (1997), a natural companion, but this story&#39;s contemporary setting will have particular resonance for many young readers, who can identify with the empowered girl as they applaud her efforts&#39; many benefits.

Here are a few places we look: <br><br><strong>-- Retail Experiences </strong><br><br><em>Restaurants, Hotels, &amp; Stores</em><br>Restaurants &amp; boutique hotel lobbies are almost unparalleled in the moods they create. Retail stores are full of display implementations that can be co-opted for display of creative work. <br><br><em>Specialty Hardware Retailers </em><br>Marine hardware outlets, antique hardware stores, and industrial kitchen suppliers stock all manner of novel gadgets to inspire new possibilities. <br><strong><br>-- Public Gathering Places</strong><br><br><em>Parks &amp; Playgrounds</em><br>Endless interactions of all sorts occur in these spaces that provide insight into natural postures and the nuances of group interactions. <br><br><em>Airports &amp; Parking Garages</em><br>Guiding travelers is a door-to-door experiment in designing way-finding. Parking garages in particular feature innovative uses of signage, color coding, and memory cues. <br><br><strong>-- Places Where Things Are Made</strong><br><br><em>Prep Kitchen &amp; Food Trucks</em><br>Food prep is creative work that occurs under great time pressure. Cooks consitently invent ways to produce during the constraints of a mad dinner rush. <br><br><em>Sound Stages &amp; Theaters </em><br>Sound stages are designed to support the realization of imagination.

Gallery spaces are constantly reconfigured to adapt for the needs of a show. <br><br><em>Pre-schools &amp; Kindergartens</em><br>Learning environments for young kids are one of the few places where physicality is embraced -- kids love to move around. These spaces are also full of materials to engage in playful building activities. <br> <strong>-- Service Industries</strong> <em></em> <br> <em>Hospitals</em> <br>Emergency rooms in particular are filled with clever solutions to coordinate action among staff and service the often complex emotional needs of patients. <br><em></em><em></em> <em></em> <br><em>Repair Shops</em> <br>Bike mechanics, oil-change garages, tailors, and shoe repair shops all have unique tools &amp; configurations for optimizing space, time, and money.make space is about creative spaces and about creating spaces.

This connectedness is found in many incarnations: in the rapid growth of the Internet, in the ease with which global communication takes place, and in the ability of news and information as well as epidemics and financial crises to spread with surprising speed and intensity. These are phenomena that involve networks, incentives, and the aggregate behavior of groups of people; they are based on the links that connect us and the ways in which our decisions can have subtle consequences for others. This introductory undergraduate textbook takes an interdisciplinary look at economics, sociology, computing and information science, and applied mathematics to understand networks and behavior. It describes the emerging field of study that is growing at the interface of these areas, addressing fundamental questions about how the social, economic, and technological worlds are connected.</p><p>This introductory undergraduate textbook draws on economics, sociology, computing and information science, and applied mathematics to understand networks and behavior.

Even the simplest system can be subject to chaos, denying us accurate predictions of its behavior, and sometimes giving rise to astonishing structures of large-scale order. Here, Leonard Smith shows that we all have an intuitive understanding of chaotic systems. He uses accessible math and physics to explain Chaos Theory, and points to numerous examples in philosophy and literature that illuminate the problems. This book provides a complete understanding of chaotic dynamics, using examples from mathematics, physics, philosophy, and the real world, with an explanation of why chaos is important and how it differs from the idea of randomness. The author's real life applications include the weather forecast, a pendulum, a coin toss, mass transit, politics, and the role of chaos in gambling and the stock market. <em>Chaos</em> represents a prime opportunity for mathematical lay people to finally get a clear understanding of this fascinating concept.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Fearing God is the soul of godliness, and those who claim to love God should desire to understand what it means to fear Him. <i>The Forgotten Fear</i> revisits this important topic. Author Al Martin first establishes the theme of the fear of God in both the Old and New Testaments, and then he defines what fearing God means. Finally, he addresses the practical implications of fearing God, showing its expression in the lives of Abraham and Joseph and providing instruction for believers today to maintain their fear of God and even increase it.<p> <b>Table of Contents:</b><br> 1. Predominance of the Fear of God in Biblical Thought<br> 2. Definition of the Fear of God<br> 3. Ingredients of the Fear of God<br> 4. Source of the Fear of God<br> 5. Relationship of the Fear of God to Our Conduct<br> 6. How to Maintain and Increase the Fear of God<br> 7. A Final Word to the Reader<br></p></p><p>Albert N. Martin served as a pastor of Trinity Baptist Church of Montville, New Jersey for forty-six years. He now resides in western Michigan with his wife, Dorothy.The twenty-first-century church desperately needs this book. The fear of God is evaporating from our consciousness, and the effects are tragically public. I am convinced that Albert Martin is casting forth the seeds of the revival that we need in the nick of time. <i>The Forgotten Fear</i> of God is a comprehensive journey from Genesis to Revelation, tracing the rich contours of this pivotal doctrine. It is a feast full of surprises. We need the kind of revival that springs from the godly fear of God. This book is a gift to the church in time of need. You will know and love God more after reading it. --Scott Brown, president, National Center for Family-Integrated Churches<br><br>There is arguably no better and no wiser voice to speak about the fear of God than Pastor Albert Martin. In this book you will find a wonderful balance of a solid biblical argument linked with a heart-piercing application for both the believer as well as the unbeliever. Pastor Martin handles this lost and controversial topic with a pastoral tenderness that is warm and inviting and highlights well that the fear of God is a doctrine which should draw us near to God in worship and awe, not cause us to run from Him. This book will move you to worship God and marvel at the work of Christ on our behalf all the more. --Brian Croft, senior pastor, Auburndale Baptist Church; founder, Practical Shepherding; and senior fellow, Mathena Center for Church Revitalization, SBTS</p><h2>Lily Girl&#39;s Christmas Quilt: Wine Country Quilt Series Book 2 of 5</h2><p>Lily Girl&#39;s Christmas Quilt is the second novel in Ann Hazelwood&#39;s Wine Country Quilts Series.

The gel provides the humor (and resulting head trauma). <br><br><b><i>Can you die by shaking someone&#x2019;s hand?&nbsp;</i></b>Answer: Yes.

If you could, the results would be as disastrous as a medium-sized hydrogen bomb. <br><br><b><i>If you were Cookie Monster, just how many cookies could you actually eat in one sitting?&nbsp;</i></b>Answer: Most stomachs can hold up to sixty cookies, or around four liters.

The small farms that surround the centuries-old Lear House are managed by her father, agent to the wealthy, reckless Sir Thomas Blakely. Tenant farmers sell the oats and rye they grow to pay rent to Sir Thomas, surviving on the potatoes that flourish in the remaining scraps of land.

Terrible, frightening screams that echoed through her bedroom. Her heart pounded and sweat beaded on her body. Her long hair hung around her face in damp strands. She clapped a hand over her mouth to still the cries, her throat raw even as her eyes darted around the room. Searching. Always searching.</p><p>She searched the high places first&#x2014;anywhere he could be crouched. Watching. Waiting to strike. She searched the windows. The glass was covered with bars, but she knew that wouldn&#x2019;t stop him if he found her. <i>Nothing</i> ever stopped him. He could get inside any house, any building. Anywhere. Rafe Cordeau, the thing of nightmares.</p><p>She was safe. She had to be. She lived completely off the grid. Underground. She only came out at night. Her one exception to her night rule was her hour of running just before sunset. She worked in a quiet part of town, in a store no one would ever consider she would work in. Rafe would never figure it out, not in a million years. He couldn&#x2019;t find her this time. She&#x2019;d planned too carefully. She&#x2019;d even stolen enough money to get herself a start. Right out of his safe. The one no one could crack. She&#x2019;d done that. He wasn&#x2019;t going to get his hands on her again. Never again.</p><p>She fell back against the pillows, drawing her knees into her chest, making herself into a small, protected ball, rocking gently to try to calm herself, to push the terror of the nightmare away. She could taste bile in her mouth.</p><p>Drawing in great, deep breaths to try to control her wild heart, she felt something else, something inside unfurl and stretch. It terrified her too. There was something in her, biding its time, waiting for a chance to get out, and she feared it was a monster. She feared <i>he&#x2019;d </i>put it there, he&#x2019;d somehow made her like him.</p><p>She knew she wouldn&#x2019;t go back to sleep. Every window was covered with heavy drapes to block out the sun, but still, she would never be able to go back to sleep. She forced her legs to straighten. That hurt. Every muscle was sore from the terrible coiling in her body. She knew from experience it would be like that all day, her body feeling as if someone had beat her up with a baseball bat.</p><p>She sat up and scooted to the side of the bed, first, as she always did, feeling for the gun hidden beneath her pillow. The solid weight of it always made her feel better. She worked out, trained hard, even when she knew she still wouldn&#x2019;t have a chance against him if he found her. Even so, she lived her life. Held herself still. Kept to herself. Reduced his odds.</p><p>She took a shower in the small cubicle. It was a rigged hose with a spray nozzle over the top of a tiny booth with a drain. It didn&#x2019;t matter. She was safe. She lived in a warehouse, not her car. Mostly the warehouse was empty, but her martial arts instructor owned the property and he&#x2019;d allowed her to rent the space when he realized she was living out of her car. He had barred the windows for her. She had put in the double locks herself.</p><p>She had done everything necessary to make herself safe, but then she&#x2019;d made a vow. She would be happy every single second she was living free and alive. She wouldn&#x2019;t hide in the warehouse, shut away from the world, she would <i>live</i>. She&#x2019;d be smart and careful about it, but this time, she wouldn&#x2019;t be a mouse hiding. It hadn&#x2019;t done her much good the last time, and she wasted that little bit of freedom she&#x2019;d had. The price definitely hadn&#x2019;t been worth it then. She was going to make certain it was this time.</p><p>Catarina pressed her fingers hard against her temples, unwilling to revisit the moment when he&#x2019;d last found her and his terrible punishment. Her entire body shuddered. She&#x2019;d paid dearly, but that had only made her all the more determined to escape permanently. She&#x2019;d been terrified and he thought that terror would work to his advantage. She let him think that, and then she&#x2019;d escaped again.</p><p>Her life had really started with her martial arts instructor. Malcom Hardy was in his late sixties and from the moment she&#x2019;d entered his class, he&#x2019;d seemed to know something was wrong. He didn&#x2019;t exactly ask questions, but somehow he found out she was living out of her car and he casually mentioned his empty warehouse. That had been the start of their strange friendship.</p><p>Catarina had never had a friendship with anyone before, and at first she was distrustful of his motives. It had taken Malcom months to gain her trust enough that she stayed and had a few words privately with him after each class. She hadn&#x2019;t told him her past, only that she was looking for a job and needed a safe home. She&#x2019;d used the word <i>safe</i> in the hopes that he would understand without an explanation&#x2014;and he had.</p><p>When she&#x2019;d escaped, she hadn&#x2019;t taken tons of money from the safe because she didn&#x2019;t want Rafe to have more reason to come after her if by chance he&#x2019;d given up on her. That meant she didn&#x2019;t have a lot of money. It also meant, if he had given up on her, he&#x2019;d send his kill squad after her. Either way she wasn&#x2019;t safe and she needed to be very careful with her money.</p><p>Malcom slowly won her over with his many simple kindnesses. He casually dropped by to put the bars on the windows when she&#x2019;d mentioned she was a little nervous. He&#x2019;d also been the one to find her the job after she told him what her dream job would be.</p><p>Catarina loved her job. The coffee-house-slash-bookstore was old, the kind where poets and writers came and read their work every Friday. It was a throwback world that suited her. Books were everywhere, and people gathered to talk and read and show off their work. She liked that the place was a tribute to a bygone era and the regulars who occupied it were loyal and definitely different.</p><p>She made certain never to stand out. She dressed in loose-fitting jeans. A loose-fitting shirt. Her hair had always grown thick and fast and got worse the more she cut it. She&#x2019;d given up on short hair so she pulled it back in a ponytail or braid and often wore hats. Since everyone who came to the coffee-house wore berets or felt hats, she wasn&#x2019;t out of place. Most wore sunglasses, even at night, as well, so she did that too, hiding her unusually colored cobalt eyes.</p><p>The coffee-house stayed open nearly twenty-four hours, and she had the shift that ran from seven in the evening until three in the morning, when she closed the shop. They got a large influx of people looking to wind down from drinking, dancing and clubbing at the bars that closed at two. She wasn&#x2019;t fond of that particular crowd, but she&#x2019;d grown used to it.</p><p>She spent an hour on working the heavy bag Malcom had hung for her and another hour doing sit-ups and crunches and push-ups. She dressed in baggy sweats and went running. That killed another hour and put her to sunset. Another shower and she headed for the coffee-house.</p><p>She tried hard not to allow her heart to do a little stutter, wondering if the new instructor Malcom had hired would drop by again. She liked looking at him. He was a bonus at the dojo as well as the coffee-house. She&#x2019;d never found herself looking at a man before&#x2014;she&#x2019;d never dared to. But he was special. Everything about him was special.</p><p>He&#x2019;d been at the dojo a month, and she&#x2019;d watched him with the same distrust she had for anyone new who came into her world. He was absolutely the most beautiful man she&#x2019;d ever seen in her life. He was brutal when he fought, and yet, at the same time, graceful and fluid. Sheer poetry. He was light on his feet, very fast, so smooth. He was always, always utterly calm. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine him ruffled over anything. He embodied the world of martial arts&#x2014;he lived that way&#x2014;not just in the dojo but out of it.</p><p>Still, she kept her distance, even when he&#x2019;d noticed her in the dojo and smiled at her a time or two. She didn&#x2019;t smile back. She didn&#x2019;t encourage any kind of a relationship, nor did she want one. Not because she didn&#x2019;t ever talk to people, but because he made her feel something she&#x2019;d never felt before. But she liked looking at him. Maybe a little too much.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t have flights of erotic fantasy or dreams. Her body had never awakened, on fire, burning with need and hunger. Her breasts hadn&#x2019;t felt swollen and achy, desperate for a man&#x2019;s touch. Not until she laid eyes on Malcom&#x2019;s new instructor. Something moved in her. Something took over, and unexpectedly, at night, when she wasn&#x2019;t having nightmares, she had erotic dreams that burned through her body until she couldn&#x2019;t breathe. Abruptly they&#x2019;d leave her, and once they were gone her body would settle and she&#x2019;d be perfectly fine again. He was definitely someone she needed to stay away from, but looking at him was acceptable.</p><p>He&#x2019;d sauntered into the coffee-house two weeks after starting with Malcom. She&#x2019;d noticed him immediately. How could she not? When he moved, the roped muscles of his body, even beneath his tight black shirt, did a delicious kind of rippling that drew every feminine eye in the place. Ridley Cromer. The name was as strange and unique as the man.</p><p>Catarina stood outside the coffee-house just staring into the windows, feeling happy. She always made certain she acknowledged being happy. That was important. She woke up in the morning and always, <i>always</i> told herself she would be happy that day.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, beautiful.&#x201d;</p><p>She froze, the smile fading. The other thing strange about Ridley Cromer was the fact that she never heard him when he came near her. He didn&#x2019;t make a sound. She heard everyone. She always knew when someone was close to her. The reason why she excelled in martial arts was because she always anticipated her opponent&#x2019;s move. It was as if she had a kind of radar telling her where everyone was at all times within her space. Everyone but Ridley Cromer.</p><p>She turned her head, holding her breath, her smile fading. Her eyes met Ridley&#x2019;s and the impact was so strong the air rushed from her lungs as if she&#x2019;d been punched. He had beautiful eyes. Intense. The way he looked at her was intense. Everything about him was intense. And Zen. Very Zen.</p><p>She forced herself to nod out of politeness. She knew if she tried to speak she would squeak like a mouse and nothing else would emerge. Ridley Cromer was fine to look at. Daydream about. Even have night fantasies over, but there was no talking. No interaction. Not ever. If all the rest of the world of women were smart, they&#x2019;d adopt her steadfast rules with him.</p><p>&#x201c;You working tonight or just looking for company?&#x201d;</p><p>His voice was low and sexy. Her pulse beat hard in her throat. She swallowed hard. She&#x2019;d never had a crush on anyone in her life, but he was standing right in front of her. Towering over her. His eyes smiled and his white teeth flashed. He should be locked up to preserve all women&#x2019;s virtues.</p><p>She shook her head and reached for the door handle. He reached at the same time, his hand settling around hers as she grasped the knob. A shiver of absolute awareness slid down her spine. Curled in her belly. There was a sudden tingle in her breasts and she felt heat gathering in her very core. Not like her night fantasies, where her body burned up, but still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t let go of her hand, and she couldn&#x2019;t remove hers from the doorknob. His touch was light. Gentle. She should have pulled her hand away but she was frozen to the spot. He stepped closer, so close she could feel the heat of his body seeping into hers. He was hot. He radiated heat. His breath was warm on the nape of her neck, and for the first time she wished she&#x2019;d left her hair down to protect herself.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Cat, right? Malcom calls you Cat. You&#x2019;re his favorite student. I&#x2019;ve never known him to have a favorite. I&#x2019;m Ridley Cromer.&#x201d;</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly. Thunder roared in her ears. Her brain short-circuited. His voice was pitched so low that it seemed to slide beneath her skin and find its way directly into her bloodstream like some strange new drug. No one touched her. No one dared. He had broken that taboo. She didn&#x2019;t know how to feel about it.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re quick. Very fast,&#x201d; he went on, as if she wasn&#x2019;t the rudest person in the world for not answering him. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t help but watch you sparring the other day. You were wiping up the floor with men ranked much higher than you. Men with a lot more experience. It was a thing of beauty.&#x201d;</p><p><i>A thing of beauty.</i> She would hold that close to her and think about it when she was alone. A compliment. Coming from someone who clearly could best anyone in the dojo, probably including Malcom, it was very high praise. Still, she couldn&#x2019;t stand there being an absolute idiot.</p><p>She finally found her wits and gave the door a desperate twist, flashing what she hoped was a careless smile of thanks over her shoulder at him. She yanked open the door, but found when she stepped back she stepped right into him. <i>Right</i> into him.</p><p>His body was as hard as a rock. It was rather like smashing herself against an oak tree. His arms came around her automatically to steady her. The heat radiating from him nearly burned right through her clothes.</p><p>To her absolute horror, she banged the door closed again as she threw herself forward and away from him. She nearly ran into the heavy glass, but his hands were suddenly at her waist, gently moving her away from the door.</p><p>One moment she was heading for danger; the next he had literally lifted her and put her a foot away from the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Kitten, you&#x2019;d better let me get that.&#x201d;</p><p>Color rushed up her neck into her face. To her everlasting mortification, she could hear male amusement in his voice. She was an idiot&#x2014;a tongue-tied idiot&#x2014;and he&#x2019;d think she was crazy. Still&#x2014;she gulped air&#x2014;that was for the best. He&#x2019;d just dismiss her, hopefully never look at her again. Not with those eyes. Those beautiful, antique gold eyes. Who had eyes that color?</p><p>He pulled the door open and held it, waiting for her to go through. Thankfully she found her legs and moved past him, once again throwing a small, hopefully thankful smile at him over her shoulder. She walked stiffly to the counter and shoved her things beneath it on the other side.</p><p>She was absolutely certain someone needed to file away books in the back where no one could see her. Someone else could make the coffee tonight and she&#x2019;d just go hide.</p><p>&#x201c;Cat, great, you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d; David Belmont, the owner of Poetry Slam, threw her an apron. &#x201c;Get to it, hon. Everyone&#x2019;s been complaining because apparently my coffee doesn&#x2019;t taste like yours. I&#x2019;ve watched you a million times and I do exactly the same thing, but it never comes out like yours.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t like making coffee, David,&#x201d; Catarina replied, and put on her apron. Which she found hilarious because he owned the coffee-house.</p><p>The moment she was behind the coffee machine, David moved into position to take orders and money. Clearly there he was in his element, chatting up the customers, remembering their names, talking them into some of the bakery goods sold with the coffee. He even remembered the poetry or short stories they wrote. He was awesome with the customers, and she was awesome with the coffee. They made a great team.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t look up when anyone ordered.

In Northup's world, whole foods and loving communication can play just as important roles as antibiotics. </p><p> The book is categorized somewhat loosely by age, beginning with pregnancy and labor, and continuing through infancy, childhood, adolescence and young adulthood. Each section is quite specifically tuned to relating to daughters: Mothers of sons will get some use out of sections on breastfeeding, vaccinations and the like, but emotional concerns and physical recommendations are tailor-made for women and girls, right down to the resource guide that ends the book.

It takes an approach unprecedented among introductions to this subject, by providing full coverage of Jewish and Christian thinkers as well as Muslims, and by taking the story of philosophy from its beginnings in the world of early Islam all the way through to the twentieth century. Major figures like Avicenna, Averroes, and Maimonides are covered in great detail, but the book also looks at less familiar thinkers, including women philosophers. Attention is also given to the philosophical relevance of Islamic theology (kalam) and mysticism--the Sufi tradition within Islam, and Kabbalah among Jews--and to science, with chapters on disciplines like optics and astronomy. The book is divided into three sections, with the first looking at the first blossoming of Islamic theology and responses to the Greek philosophical tradition in the world of Arabic learning. This 'formative period' culminates with the work of Avicenna, the pivotal figure to whom most later thinkers feel they must respond. The second part of the book discusses philosophy in Muslim Spain (Andalusia), where Jewish philosophers come to the fore, though this is also the setting for such thinkers as Averroes and Ibn Arabi. Finally, a third section looks in unusual detail at later developments, touching on philosophy in the Ottoman, Mughal, and Safavid empires and showing how thinkers in the nineteenth to the twentieth century were still concerned to respond to the ideas that had animated philosophy in the Islamic world for centuries, while also responding to political and intellectual challenges from the European colonial powers.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Adamson</strong> took his doctorate from the University of Notre Dame and first worked at King's College London.

There's a 10-year waiting list for Henderson's heirloom acoustic guitars&#x2014;and even a musical legend like Eric Clapton must wait his turn. Partly out of self-interest, St. John prods Henderson into finally building Clapton's guitar, and soon we get to pull up a dusty stool and watch this Stradivari in glue-stained blue jeans work his magic. The story that ensues will captivate you with its portrait of a world where craftsmanship counts more than commerce, and time is measured by old jokes, old-time music, and homemade lemon pies shared by good friends.</p><p>People will go to great lengths to get master craftsman Wayne Henderson to build them an instrument. If you're an award-winning journalist like St. John and you want to expedite the process, you write a book about Henderson that's equal parts travelogue, biography and ode to the old-fashioned trade of making top-notch guitars. Upon learning that Eric Clapton has been on Henderson's waiting list for 10 years, St. John sets out to learn about the little-known man behind the instruments every guitarist knows. He visits Henderson's Virginia home, shadowing the artist while he builds guitars, plays "old time music" concerts and doesn't build Clapton's guitar. Along the way, he finds answers to questions such as which is the best wood for guitar making (Brazilian rosewood) and how much the 1939 Martin guitar Clapton played on <i>Unplugged</i> was auctioned for ($700,000). When St. John finally helps cajole Henderson into building two guitars for Clapton (one to be auctioned for charity), Henderson's and St. John's expertise shine through. St. John's descriptions of Henderson choosing wood, making a dovetail neck joint or whittling bracings for the guitar-top are as detailed, refined and playful as the instruments Henderson creates.

Company School painting was the result of commissions made by East India Company patrons from Indian artists between the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. </p><p>Edited by writer and historian William Dalrymple (guest curator of the exhibition), the book explores both the beauty of the Indian natural world and the social realities of the time. It showcases these dazzling and often surprising artworks which offer a rare glimpse of the cultural fusion between British and Indian artistic styles during this period, and belatedly honours Indian artists such as Shaikh Zain ud-Din of Patna, Bhawani Das, Shaikh Mohammad Amir of Karriyah, Sita Ram, Yellapah of Vellore and the last master of the great Mughal atelier, Ghulam Ali Khan. In doing so it sheds light on a forgotten moment in Anglo-Indian history during which Indian artists responded to exposure to European influences, and recognises that the vivid and highly original paintings they produced are among the greatest masterpieces of Indian art.</p></p><p><b>William Dalrymple</b> is the award-winning author of the British best-sellers In Xanadu and The City of Djinns.

Her books are international bestsellers.<b>From Chapter One</b> <p> "Do you believe that the circumstances in Ronald Thompson's case, the fact that he committed the murder only days after his seventeenth birthday, making him barely eligible for adult punishment, should have been considered?" (Tom) Brokaw (of the <i>Today Show</i>) asked quickly. </p><p> Steve said, "As you know, I will not comment specifically on the Thompson case. It would be entirely inappropriate." </p><p> "I understand your concern, Mr. Peterson," the interviewer said, "but you had taken your position on this issue several years before..." He paused, then continued quietly, "before Ronald Thompson murdered your wife." </p><p> <i>Ronald Thompson murdered your wife.</i> The starkness of the words still surprised Steve. After two and a half years, he could still feel the sense of shock and outrage that Nina had died that way, her life snuffed out by the intruder who came into their home, by the hands that had relentlessly twisted her scarf around her throat. </p><p> Trying to blot the image from his mind, he looked directly ahead. "At one time, I had hoped that the ban on executions in our country might become a permanent one. But as you point out, long before the tragedy in my own family, I had come to the conclusion that if we were to preserve the most fundamental right of human beings...freedom to come and go without fear, freedom to feel sanctuary in our homes, we had to stop the perpetrators of violence. Unfortunately the only way to stop potential murderers seems to be to threaten them with the same harsh judgment they mete out to their victims. And since the first execution was carried out two years ago, the number of murders has dropped dramatically in major cities across the country." </p><p> Sharon leaned forward. "You make it sound so reasonable," she cried. "Don't you realize that forty-five percent of murders are committed by people under 25 years of age, many of whom have tragic family backgrounds and a history of instability?" </p><p> The solitary viewer in Biltmore's room 932 took his eyes from Steve Peterson and studied the girl thoughtfully. This was the writer Steve was getting serious about. She wasn't at all like his wife. She was obviously taller and had the slender body of someone who might be athletic. His wife had been small and doll-like with rounded breasts and jet black hair that curled around her forehead and ears when she turned her head. </p><p> Sharon Martin's eyes reminded him of the color of the ocean that day he'd driven down to the beach last summer. He'd heard that Jones Beach was a good place to meet girls but it hadn't worked out. The one he'd started to fool with in the water had called "Bob!" and a minute later this guy had been beside him, asking what his problem was. So he'd moved his blanket and just stared out at the ocean, watching the changing colors. Green. That was it. Green mixed with blue and churning. He liked eyes that color. </p><p> What was Steve saying? Oh yes, he'd said something about feeling sorry for the victims, not their murderers, "for people incapable of defending themselves." </p><p> "My sympathies are with them too," Sharon cried "But it's not either/or. Don't you see that life imprisonment would be punishment enough for the Ronald Thompsons of this world?" She forgot Tom Brokaw, forgot the television cameras as once again she tried to convince Steve. "How can you...who are so compassionate...who value life so much...want to play God?" she asked. "How can anyone presume to play God?" </p><p> It was an argument that began and ended the same way as it had that first time six months ago when they'd met on this program. Finally Tom Brokaw said, "Our time is running out. Can we sum up by saying that notwithstanding the public demonstrations, prison riots and student rallys that are regularly occurring all over the country, you still believe, Mr. Peterson, that the sharp drop in random murder justifies execution?" </p><p> "I believe in the moral right...the duty...of society to protect itself, and of the government to protect the sacred liberty of its citizens," Steve said. </p><p> "Sharon Martin?" Brokaw turned quickly to her. "I believe that the death penalty is senseless and brutalizing. I believe that we can make the home and streets safe by removing violent offenders and punishing them with swift, sure sentences, by voting for the bond issues that will build the necessary correctional institutions and will pay the people who staff them. I believe that it is our reverence for life, all life, that is the final test of us as individuals and as a society." </p><p> Tom Brokaw said hurriedly, "Sharon Martin, Steven Peterson, thank you for being with us on <i>Today.</i> I'll be back after this message..." </p><p> The television set in room 932 of the Biltmore was snapped off. For a long time the muscular, thick-chested man in the green-plaid suit sat staring straight ahead at the darkened screen. Once again he reviewed his plan, the plan that began with putting the pictures and the suitcase in the secret room in Grand Central Station and would end with bringing Steve Peterson's son Neil there tonight. But now he had to decide. Sharon Martin was going to be at Steve's house this evening. She would be minding Neil until Steve got home.</p><p> He'd planned simply to eliminate her there. </p><p> But should he? She was so beautiful. </p><p> He thought of those eyes, the color of the ocean, churning, caring. </p><p> It seemed to him that when she looked directly into the camera she had been looking at him. It seemed as though she wanted him to come for her. </p><p> Maybe she loved him. </p><p> If she didn't it would be easy to get rid of her. </p><p> He'd just leave her in the room in Grand Central with the child on Wednesday morning. </p><p> Then at 11:30 when the bomb went off, she, too, would be blown to bits. </p><p> </p><p>Copyright � 1977 by Mary Higgins Clark</p></p><h2>Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths And Total Nonsense: Profiting From Evidence-Based Management</h2><p>The best organizations have the best talent. . . Financial incentives drive company performance. . . Firms must change or die. Popular axioms like these drive business decisions every day. Yet too much common management wisdom&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t wise at all but, instead, flawed knowledge based on best practices&#x201d; that are actually poor, incomplete, or outright obsolete. Worse, legions of managers use this dubious knowledge to make decisions that are hazardous to organizational health.<br><br>Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I. Sutton show how companies can bolster performance and trump the competition through evidence-based management, an approach to decision-making and action that is driven by hard facts rather than half-truths or hype. This book guides managers in using this approach to dismantle six widely held but ultimately flawed management beliefs in core areas including leadership, strategy, change, talent, financial incentives, and work-life balance. The authors show managers how to find and apply the best practices for their companies, rather than blindly copy what seems to have worked elsewhere.<br><br>This practical and candid book challenges leaders to commit to evidence-based management as a way of organizational life and shows how to finally turn this common sense into common practice.</p><p><b>Jeffrey Pfeffer</b> is Professor of Organizational Behavior at Stanford&#x2019;s Graduate School of Business. <b>Robert I.

She had no idea that her life-changing travels would have both in spades -- as well as danger and intrigue -- when she catches the eye of ship owner Boyd Anderson and inadvertently stumbles upon a high-stakes kidnapping. <br> <br> When Sir Anthony Malory's young daughter is abducted from London's Hyde Park, her kidnapper mistakenly sends the ransom note to the home of Sir Anthony's brother, James. With James and his wife, Georgina, in the Caribbean, the demands are received by their houseguest -- Georgina's youngest brother, Boyd Anderson. Searching for the girl with Anthony, the notoriously hot-headed American sea captain fully intends to make the foolhardy villain pay. But he hardly expects to find exquisite Katey Tyler, recently a passenger on his ship, at the center of the plot! <br> <br> Little does Katey realize that in having caught the attention of Boyd Anderson -- and in meeting up with the Malorys -- she's about to experience more excitement than the typical young lady encounters on a grand tour, and her life will never be dull again. A multitude of surprises await Katey, from the startling truth about her mother's early life to the lengths a man will go to win the affections of a lady who has every reason to despise him -- but who can't resist the seductive, impassioned love he has to offer her. <br> <br> With the delightful humor, lovable characters, and tempestuous passions that have placed Johanna Lindsey's eight previous Malory novels among the best-loved and most widely read romantic novels of our time, <i>No Choice But Seduction</i> sweeps readers away on an irresistible adventure that is as bold and charming as the heroine at its heart.</p><p>Johanna Lindsey is world-renowned for her &#x201c;mastery of historical romance&#x201d; (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>), with more than sixty million copies of her novels sold. She is the author of fifty-five previous national bestselling novels, many of which reached the #1 spot on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list. Lindsey lives in New Hampshire with her family.Chapter 1 <p> </p><p> <i>London, England, 1826</i> </p><p> The note was delivered by a scruffy child who didn't know he had the wrong house. The mistake wasn't his fault. He hadn't been told there were many different Malory houses in London. He'd come to the first one he'd been directed to, pleased that it hadn't taken long to earn the few coppers in his pocket. And just as he'd been told to do, he'd run off before Henry could question him. </p><p> Henry and Artie, two crusty old sea dogs, had shared the job of butler at James Malory's house ever since James had retired from his life at sea and they'd both retired with him. But recently James had gone back to sea, briefly, to rescue his brother-in-law Drew Anderson, who'd got himself into a coil when according to one of his crewmen who'd managed to escape, pirates had stolen his ship right out of London harbor! With him on it! Henry and Artie had tossed a coin to see who would sail with James for the rescue. Henry had lost. </p><p> Henry tossed the note without reading it onto the mountainous pile of calling cards and invitations that had come in from people who didn't know the Malorys of this particular household weren't in residence. A normal butler would never have let the tray on the hall table overflow with invitations and letters. But in the eight years since Henry and Artie had begun sharing the job, neither of them had learned how to be a proper butler. </p><p> That afternoon when Boyd Anderson returned to the Malory house in Berkeley Square, he found the note on his tray, along with a few other cards that had slid off the larger pile next to it. He didn't usually have a tray of his own in his sister Georgina's house, but then he usually only visited for a week or two, never as long as several months as this visit had turned out to be. Nor was it the first time Georgina's mail had got mixed up with his. </p><p> Despite having given it a lot more thought, Boyd still hadn't made up his mind yet about settling in England. But that wasn't why he was still here. He hadn't returned to sea yet because he was doing his sister a favor. Although Georgina had married into the large Malory family and any one of her numerous in-laws would have been delighted to take care of her children while she was gone, Georgina's seven-year-old daughter, Jacqueline, balked at joining her young twin siblings at the country home of their cousin Lady Regina Eden, because she didn't want to be that far away from her best friend and cousin, Judith. Other Malorys in London could have taken her, but since Boyd was staying at her London house, Georgina had asked him to keep an eye on Jacqueline until he sailed again. </p><p> He would have preferred to go along for the rescue. That would have been a fine bit of work to tease his brother Drew about. But he had, in fact, done Georgina another good turn by not insisting on going, since her husband didn't get along well with any of her brothers, himself included. The man didn't even get along with his own brothers. And there was no way he and James Malory wouldn't come to blows if they ended up on a ship together. Besides, the look on James's face when Boyd had suggested accompanying him, well, it had made Boyd glad he had an excuse to stay behind after all. </p><p> "We all know where she'd rather stay," Georgina had remarked. "But Roslynn mentioned in passing that she <i>might</i> be enceinte again, so she needs peace and quiet in her household just now, which won't be the case with Judy and Jack in residence. When you're ready to sail will be soon enough to deposit her there." </p><p> Roslynn Malory turned out not to be pregnant. Boyd ended up not sailing as expected. And Jack, as her father had named her at birth, was happy enough where she was, since she still got to visit with her cousin Judith as often as she liked. </p><p> Boyd wasn't exactly worried about Drew, anyway. Georgina did enough worrying for all of them. But Boyd knew his brother well and had no doubt that he'd extricate himself from whatever trouble he'd gotten into long before Georgina and her husband arrived to help. Hell, considering how long they'd been gone, he was beginning to suspect they hadn't even caught up to Drew's ship yet! </p><p> Georgina hadn't expected Boyd to stay in London this long. No one had, himself included. But when his ship, <i>The Oceanus,</i> returned from the short run he'd sent her on, instead of leaving with her, he sent her off again. And gave more thought to giving up the sea for good. </p><p> The Andersons' family business, Skylark Shipping, also had an office in London now. While the family had avoided England for many years due to the old war and the hard feelings that had ensued from that, they were once again firmly entrenched in trading with the English. In fact, now that England was central to all of their newly acquired routes, the London office had grown considerably in the last eight years. Boyd wouldn't half mind taking over the running of it. </p><p> Become landlocked? God, why didn't he just do it already? Because oddly enough, he loved the sea. He just hated what it did to him. </p><p> Georgina had introduced him to London society more than once on his visits here. He even kept a wardrobe at her house specifically for his London stays that was more appropriate for a gentleman, since the English dressed quite a bit more fancily than sailors did! He didn't go excessive in frilly cravats or lacy cuffs as some of them did. In fact, he took a cue from his brother-in-law, James -- well-tailored, but subdued and even open-collared. And he had a few velvet jackets that spruced him up for evening social events. </p><p> On this extended visit he'd been receiving invitations to balls and soir�es from Georgina's acquaintances that knew he was still in town, and he'd occasionally accepted. He wasn't actively looking for a wife, but if the right woman showed up, that would be incentive to settle down. He'd thought he'd found her. Katey Tyler would have been the perfect woman for him -- if she wasn't already taken! </p><p> God, how did he let <i>her</i> sneak into his mind again? Once she did, it took days and a good bout of drinking to get her out again. But only briefly. She was somewhere in his thoughts more often than not. It seemed that knowing he couldn't have her because she already had a husband made him want her even more! He'd never been able to figure out what exactly it was about Katey Tyler that had twisted him inside out on that voyage. She wasn't even the kind of woman that usually caught his eye. </p><p> She was too tall for one thing, only a few inches shorter than he was. He preferred to feel tall where his women were concerned, and Mrs. Tyler didn't give him that feeling when she stood eye to eye with him. But it didn't matter. One look at her lushly abundant curves and nothing else mattered. </p><p> She could talk a lot -- about nothing. That was a remarkable feat. Even more remarkable, he'd never found that annoying! Her dimples often made her seem like she was smiling when she wasn't. And she contradicted herself a lot, which could be quite confusing, but he actually found that endearing. It made her seem charmingly absentminded. Her nose was slim, almost patrician, her brows rather thin, her mouth -- he could never think about her mouth without becoming aroused. </p><p> No woman had ever affected him like that before, or stayed in his thoughts this long. </p><p> Gabrielle Brooks had caught his interest though. What a relief that had been, assuring him that he wasn't a lost cause! She could have banished Katey from his mind -- well, that had been his original hope. Gabby had arrived in London at about the same time he did and had become Georgina and James's houseguest because her father, an old friend of James's, had asked James to sponsor her for the Season. </p><p> A pretty thing, Gabby could have turned his thoughts toward marriage if Drew hadn't been taken with her, too. Not that his carefree brother ever intended to get leg-shackled, as the English put it. But Gabby seemed to be fascinated with Drew, too, so Boyd had stopped thinking about her as a possible wife. Besides, she was the daughter of a pirate, as it turned out, and Boyd would have had a hard time getting past that simple fact. Pirates were the nemesis of honest sailors. </p><p> He glanced at the two invitations on his tray that were actually for him and carefully put back the four that were addressed to his sister. He opened the folded note since he couldn't tell whom that was for. He had to read it twice before the meaning sank in. And then he was bolting up the stairs shouting his niece's name. </p><p> When he found Jacqueline in her room, the color returned to his cheeks and his heart slowly returned to its normal beat. He read the note once more. </p><p> </p><blockquote> I have your daughter. Start gathering a fortune if you want her back. You'll be told where to bring it. </blockquote> <p> Boyd shoved the note in his pocket, deciding it had obviously been delivered to the wrong house. He wondered if any of Georgina's neighbors had daughters. He didn't know, but he'd have to take that note to the authorities. </p><p> "What's wrong, Uncle?" </p><p> Glancing at Jack's woebegone expression, Boyd replied, "I could ask you the same thing." </p><p> She started to shrug, but then she sighed and said, "Judy's riding her first horse today in Hyde Park. Not a pony, a real horse Uncle Tony bought her." </p><p> "And you weren't invited to watch?" he guessed. </p><p> "I was, but -- I think only Uncle Tony should share that with her. He's so been looking forward to it." </p><p> Boyd managed to stifle a grin. His niece was only seven years old, but sometimes she amazed him with her insight and consideration for others. She obviously wanted to be in the park watching her best friend ride her first real horse, but she'd taken the girl's father's feelings into account instead. </p><p> Boyd had known about the outing and had been afraid that Jack would feel left out. He'd actually considered buying her a horse as well, but then he realized his sister might have a fit if he did. Actually, it was James's likely reaction that had decided him against it...</p></p><h2>Accomplishments of the Duke&#39;s Daughter (Manga) Vol. 2</h2><p><p><b>FANTASY MEETS HIGH FINANCE</b></p><p>Iris used to be an ordinary office drone addicted to otome games...then she woke up in one!

Diana lives with her family in Cornelia, Georgia.<br><br>Bolinda Mays was having a hard time concentrating on her biology textbook. She hadn't slept well, worrying about her grandfather. He was only in his early sixties, but he was disabled and having difficulties paying his utility bills.<br><br>She'd come home for the weekend from her college in Montana. The trip was expensive, considering the gas it took to get her back and forth in her beat-up but serviceable old truck. Thank god she had a part-time job working for a convenience store while college was in session, or she'd never have even been able to afford to come home and see about her grandfather.<br><br>It was early December. Not too long before Christmas, and she was having final exams the next week. Really cold weather would come soon. But Bolinda's stepfather was making threats again, about turning her grandfather out of the house that had once been Bolinda's mother's. Her death had left the old man at the mercy of that fortunehunting fool who had his fingers in every evil pie in Catelow, Wyoming. Bolinda shivered, thinking how impossible it was going to be for her, trying to pay off her used textbooks that she'd charged on her credit card. Now she was going to have to try to pay for her grandfather's utility bill, as well. Gas was so expensive, she thought miserably. The poor old man already had to choose between groceries and blood pressure meds. She'd thought about asking her neighbors, the Kirks, for help. But the only one of them she knew well was Cane, and he resented her. A lot. It would be dicey asking him for money. if she even dared.<br><br>Not that he didn't owe her something for all the times she'd saved people from him in the little town of Catelow, Wyoming, not too far from Jackson Hole. Cane had lost an arm overseas in the Middle East, after the last big conflict but while he was still in the service. He'd come home embittered and icy cold, hating everyone. He'd started drinking, refused physical therapy, refused counseling and then gone hog wild.<br><br>Every couple of weeks, he treed the local bar. The other Kirk brothers, Mallory and Dalton, always paid the bills and they knew the owner of the tavern, who was kind enough not to have Cane arrested. But the only person who could do anything with Cane was Bolinda, or Bodie as her friends called her. Even Morie, Mallory Kirk's new wife, couldn't deal with a drunken Cane. He was intimidating.<br><br>Not so much to Bolinda. She understood him, as few other people did. Amazing, considering that she was only twenty-two and he was thirty-four. That was one big age difference. It never seemed to matter. Cane talked to her as if she were his age, often about things that she had no business knowing. He seemed to consider her one of the guys.<br><br>She didn't look like a guy. She wasn't largely endowed in the bra department, of course. Her breasts were small and pert, but nothing like the women in those guy magazines. She knew that, because Cane had dated a centerfold model once and told Bodie all about her. Another embarrassing conversation when he was drunk that he probably didn't even remember.<br><br>She shook her head and tried again to concentrate on her biology textbook. She sighed, running a hand through her short, wavy black hair. Her odd, pale brown eyes were riveted to the drawings of internal human anatomy, but she just couldn't seem to make her brain work. There was going to be a final next week, along with an oral lab, and she didn't want to be the student trying to hide under the table when the professor started asking questions.<br><br>She shifted on the carpeted floor, on her stomach, and tried again to concentrate. Music started playing. Strange. That sounded like the musical ring of her cell phone, the theme from the <em>Star Trek</em> movie...<br><br>"Hey, Bodie, it's for you!" her grandfather called from the next room, where she'd left her cell phone in her coat pocket.<br><br>She muttered something and got to her feet. "Who is it, Granddaddy?"<br><br>"I don't know, sugar." He handed Bodie's cell phone to her.<br><br>"Thanks," she whispered. "Hello?" she said into the phone.<br><br>"Uh, Miss Mays?" came a hesitant voice over the line.<br><br>She recognized who was calling immediately. She ground her teeth together. "I won't come!" she said. "I'm studying for a biology test. I've got a lab, to boot.!"<br><br>"Aw, please?" the voice came again. "They're threatening to call the police. I think they'll do it this time. The newspapers would have a field day."<br><br>There was a pregnant pause. Her lips made a thin line. "Oh, damn!" she muttered.<br><br>"Darby says he'll come get you. In fact," the cowboy added hopefully, "he's sitting right outside your house right now."<br><br>Bodie stomped to the window and looked out the blinds. There was a big black Kirk ranch truck parked in the driveway, with the lights on and the engine running.<br><br>"Please?" the cowboy asked again.<br><br>"All right." She hung up in the middle of his<br><br>"Thank you!"<br><br>She grabbed her jacket and her purse and slipped into her boots. "I have to go out for an hour. I won't be too long," she told her grandfather.<br><br>Rafe Mays, used to the drill, pursed his lips. "you should get combat pay," he pointed out.<br><br>Bodie rolled her eyes and walked out the door. "I hope I won't be long," she said before she pulled it shut.<br><br>She got into the truck. Darby Hanes, the Kirks' longtime foreman, gave her a wistful smile.<br><br>"I know. I'm sorry. But you're the only person who can do anything with him. He's tearing up the bar. They're getting tired of the weekly routine." He pulled out into the road, after making sure she had her seat belt on. "He had a date last night up in Jackson Hole. Ended badly, I'm guessing, from all the cussing he did when he got home."<br><br>She didn't reply. She hated knowing about Cane Kirk's girlfriends. He seemed to have a lot of them, even with his disability. Not that it made any difference to her. Cane would still be Cane no matter what. She loved him. She'd loved him since she graduated from high school, when he presented her with a bouquet of pink roses, her favorite, and a bottle of very expensive floral perfume. He'd even kissed her. On the cheek, of course, like a treasured child more than like an adult. Her grandfather had worked for the Rancho Real until his health failed and he had to quit. That had been while Cane was still in the military, after the second Gulf War, before the terrible roadside bomb had robbed him of most of his left arm, and almost of his life.<br><br>She supposed Cane was fond of her. It wasn't until last year that everyone had discovered her almost magical ability to calm him when he went on drinking sprees. Since then, when he went on benders, Bodie was recruited to fetch him home. There had been a brief period of time when he'd gone to therapy, been measured for a prosthesis and seemed to be adjusting nicely to his new life.<br><br>And then it had all gone south, for reasons nobody knew. His bar crawls had become legendary. The expense was terrible, because his brothers, Mallory and Dalton, had to pick up the expense. Cane got a monthly check from the army, but nobody could entice him to apply for disability. He went to show cattle, with a cowboy who handled the big bulls for him, and he was the idea man for the Kirk ranch. He was good at PR, worked to liaison with the national cattlemen's lobby, kept up with current legislation that affected the cattle industry and generally was the spokesman for the Kirk ranch.<br><br>When he was sober.<br><br>Lately he wasn't. Not a lot.<br><br>"Any idea what happened?" Bodie asked curiously, because Darby would know. He knew everything that went on around the Rancho Real, or "royal ranch" in Spanish, named by the original owner, a titled gentleman from valladolid, northwest of Madrid, Spain, who started it way back in the late 1800s.<br><br>Darby glanced at her and grimaced. It was dark and very cold, even with the heater running and the old but serviceable coat Bodie was wearing.<br><br>"I have an idea," he confessed. "But if Cane ever found out I told you, I'd be standing in the unemployment line."<br><br>She sighed and fiddled with the fanny pack she wore in lieu of carrying around a cumbersome purse. "She must have said something about his arm."<br><br>He nodded faintly. "That would be my guess.<br><br>He's really sensitive about it. Funny," he added solemnly, "I thought he was getting better."<br><br>"If he'd get back in therapy, mental and physical, he'd improve," she replied.<br><br>"Sure, but he won't even talk about it. He's sinking into himself," he added quietly.<br><br>"There goes that theoretical physics mind working overtime again," she teased, because most people didn't know about Darby's degree in that field.<br><br>He shrugged. "Hey, I just manage cattle."<br><br>"I'll bet you sit around in your room at night imagining the route to a new and powerful unified field theory." She chuckled.<br><br>"Only on Thursdays," he said, laughing out loud. "At least my chosen field of study doesn't leave me covered in mud and using shovels and trowels in holes around the country."<br><br>"Don't knock anthropology," she said firmly. "We'll find the missing link one day, and you can say you knew me before I was famous, like that guy in Egypt who's always in documentaries about pharaohs' tombs." She lifted her rounded chin. "Nothing wrong with honest work."<br><br>He made a face. "Digging up bones."<br><br>"Bones can tell you a lot," she replied.<br><br>"So they say. Here it is," he added, nodding toward the little out-of-the-way bar that Cane frequented. Out front was a stop sign that local drunks often used for target practice when they went driving around in four-wheel-drive vehicles late at night. Now it said "S... .p." The two middle letters were no longer recognizable.<br><br>"They need to replace that," she pointed out.<br><br>"What for? Everybody knows it means stop," he said. "Why waste good metal and paint? They'd just shoot it up again. Not much in the way of entertainment this far out in the country."<br><br>"Got a point, I guess." She sighed.<br><br>He parked in front of the bar. There were only two vehicles out there. Probably those of employees. Everybody with any sense would have left when Cane started cursing and throwing things. At least, that was the pattern.<br><br>"I'll keep the engine running. In case somebody called the sheriff this time," he mused.<br><br>"Cane and the sheriff are best friends," she reminded him.<br><br>"That won't stop Cody Banks from locking him up if someone files a complaint for assault and battery," he stated. "The law is the law, friendship notwithstanding."<br><br>"I guess. Maybe it would knock some sense into him."<br><br>He shook his head. "That's been tried. Mallory even let him stew in a cell for two days. Finally bailed him out, and he went back and did it again that same weekend. Our black sheep there is out of control."<br><br>"I'll see what I can do to rein him in," she promised.<br><br>She got out of the truck, ran a hand through her short black hair and grimaced. Her brown eyes were somber as she hesitated on the porch for just a minute, and then, finally, opened the door.<br><br>The mess was bad. Tables knocked over. Chairs everywhere. One was upside down behind the bar in a pile of glass, and the place smelled like whiskey. This was going to be an expensive mess, too.<br><br>"Cane?" she called.<br><br>A thin man in a Hawaiian shirt peered over the bar. "Bodie? Thank God!"<br><br>"Where is he?" she asked.<br><br>He pointed to the bathroom.<br><br>She went toward it. She was almost there when it slammed open and Cane walked out. His long-sleeved beige Western shirt with the fancy embroidery was stained with blood. Probably his own, she thought, noting the caked blood around his nose, which was bruised, and his square jaw. His sensual mouth had a cut just at the corner, where blood was also visible. His thick, short, slightly wavy black hair was mussed. His black eyes were bloodshot. Even in that condition, he was so attractive that he made her heart pound. He was tall and broad-shouldered, with long powerful legs encased in tight jeans; his big feet in boots that still had the mirror polish on them despite his exploits. He was thirty-four to her twenty-two, but right now, he seemed much younger.<br><br>He glared at her. "Why do they always bring you?" he demanded.<br><br>She shrugged. "My unusual ability to subdue charging tigers?" she suggested.<br><br>He blinked. Then he chuckled.<br><br>She went forward and took one of his big hands in hers. The knuckles were bruised and swollen and smeared with blood. She couldn't tell if it was his or somebody else's. "Mallory's going to be mad."<br><br>"Mallory isn't home," he said in a loud whisper. He even grinned. "He and Morie went to Louisiana to see a bull. They won't be back until tomorrow."<br><br>"Tank won't be happy, either," she added, using the nickname that family used for Dalton, the youngest brother.<br><br>He shrugged. "Tank will be knee-deep in those old Tom Mix silent cowboy movies he likes. It's Saturday night. He makes popcorn, takes the phone off the hook, locks himself in and saturates himself with black-and-white cinema."<br><br>"That's what you should be doing, instead of wrecking bars!" she muttered.<br><br></p><h2>Nadia Knox and the Eye of Zinnia</h2><p><b> Nadia Knox knows all about secrets, but nothing has prepared her for what the Eye of Zinnia will reveal! </b><br>(Ages 8-12) <br>For as long as she can remember, Nadia and her younger brother, Chris, have been tagging along with their parents as they travel the world searching for the untold stories of ancient societies, including the Kamju, a civilization hidden deep in the wilds of Uganda.&nbsp;<br>Nadia knows how important this discovery could be to her parents, but she can&#x2019;t shake the feeling that something is wrong.

We went in search of big Tex-Mex cooking, which San Antonio is known for. I chose Los Barrios from the many Tex-Mex restaurants in the city because I fell in love with Diana Barrios Trevi�o and the entire Barrios family. . . . The dishes they have created contain amazing combinations and flavors that many people don&#x2019;t get to experience. I wanted the rest of the country to sample what I was tasting. I wanted people to realize that true Tex-Mex cooking isn&#x2019;t just fajitas and burritos. Now, with the Los Barrios Family Cookbook, I am excited to know that people across the country can easily prepare and taste all of the delicious dishes I experienced on my visit.

There is more to the Pilgrims&#x2019; story&#x2015;more to American identity and character&#x2015;than our Thanksgiving rituals and reveries.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br>The voyage of the <i>Mayflower</i> and the founding of Plymouth Colony is one of the seminal events in world history. But the poorly-equipped group of English Puritans who ventured across the Atlantic in the early autumn of 1620 had no sense they would pass into legend. They had eighty casks of butter and two dogs but no cattle for milk, meat, or ploughing. They were ill-prepared for the brutal journey and the new land that few of them could comprehend. But the <i>Mayflower </i>story did not end with these Pilgrims&#x2019; arrival on the coast of New England or their first uncertain years as settlers. Rebecca Fraser traces two generations of one ordinary family and their extraordinary response to the challenges of life in America.</p><p> Edward Winslow, an apprentice printer, fled England and then Holland for a life of religious freedom and opportunity. Despite the intense physical trials of settlement, he found America exotic, enticing, and endlessly interesting. He built a home and a family, and his remarkable friendship with King Massassoit, Chief of the Wampanoags, is part of the legend of Thanksgiving. Yet, fifty years later, Edward&#x2019;s son Josiah was commanding the New England militias against Massassoit&#x2019;s son in King Philip&#x2019;s War. </p><p> <i>The Mayflower </i>is an intensely human portrait of the Winslow family written with the pace of an epic. Rebecca Fraser details domestic life in the seventeenth century, the histories of brave and vocal Puritan women and the contradictions between generations as fathers and sons made the painful decisions which determined their future in America.</p></p><p><b>Rebecca Fraser</b>, daughter of noted British historian Lady Antonia Fraser, is the author of <i>The Story of Britain</i>, which has been described as "an elegantly written, impressively well-informed single-volume history of how England was governed during the past 2000 years." A reviewer and broadcaster, her previous work also includes a biography of Charlotte Bront� which examined her life within the framework of contemporary attitudes to women. Rebecca Fraser was President of the Bront� Society for many years.<p>&#x201c;There is nothing sleep-inducing about the chronicle crafted by Ms. Fraser . . . the Thanksgiving Day events so central to American identity and character merit a mere three sentences in a book that spans more than 300 pages. The lesson: There is more to the Pilgrims&#x2019; story&#x2015;more to American identity and character&#x2015;than our Thanksgiving rituals and reveries.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br>&#x201c;Rebecca Fraser brings the Pilgrims to vivid life.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br>&#x201c;Superbly written and enthralling ... <i>The Mayflower</i> reads as though it were historical fiction, with avaried cast of characters and perspectives, fine details, background histories, and a holistic approach.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<b><i>Booklist</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Fraser&#x2019;s smooth storytelling provides a revealing look into the development of the [Plymouth] colony. The story of the Winslows is an effective way to experience the emotions and fears of the small band who dauntlessly sailed off to the New World.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Rebecca Fraser tells this familiar story with wonderful immediacy; the Winslows come across not as strange characters from the distant past, but as real people with passions and anxieties familiar to us all. . . . Fraser&#x2019;s account of the Pilgrims&#x2019; progress will disappoint those who like their history simple. Hers is not a story of virtuous Pilgrims fighting to survive in a hostile land, nor is it about noble Native Americans duped by perfidious Albion. It is, though, a story of how friendships and community are destroyed by greed and vanity.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>The Times</i> (UK)</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>&#x201c;Epic in scope and pacing, this account of survival feels intimate, connecting readers to both groups in a refreshing way . . . The author&#x2019;s inclusion of indigenous history along with the struggles of women pilgrims and their importance to the community&#x2019;s success is both appreciated and necessary . . . An engaging popular history. For readers of David McCullough and Ron Chernow.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br>&#x201c;Captivating, scholarly and addictively readable . . . Rebecca Fraser has the rare gift of being able to marshal and communicate a mountainous quantity of often original research in such a deft and elegant manner that it never becomes indigestible or irrelevant.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b><i>Financial Times </i>(UK)</b></p><p>&#x201c;A brilliant combination of synthesis and original research arriving in good time for the celebration of the quincentenary of the <i>Mayflower</i>. It should also give a heavy burp of indigestion to the customary turkey-and-cranberry-sauce celebration of Thanksgiving next month, with its reminder of the way in which Winslow&#x2019;s ideals of &#x2018;love, peace and holiness&#x2019; gave way to a horrible, genocidal sequel.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b><i>The Spectator</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;A superb account . . . This book stands as a significant contribution to the already well documented field of Pilgrim history . . . a must read for those interested in the unique beginnings of America&#x201d; <b>&#x2013; Cynthia Hagar Krusell, Historian and Author of <i>The Winslows of Careswell in Marshfield</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Rebecca Fraser&#x2019;s exquisitely researched book seems to offer something new to learn &#x2013; and wonder over &#x2013; on every page. . . . The Pilgrims believed that &#x2018;the world could begin afresh in America,&#x2019; this gifted historian writes. As, eventually, it did. Deftly, indelibly, Fraser shows us the human cost.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013; Penelope Rowlands, Journalist and Author of <i>Aaron Burr's Second Act</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;The author puts the reader into the period with a front-row seat as the story unfolds . . . Fraser&#x2019;s attention to historical detail is excellent and enhances this riveting book!&#x201d; <b>&#x2013; Judith H. Swan, Former Governor General, General Society of Mayflower Descendants</b></p><p>&#x201c;A well written and far ranging perspective on the Pilgrims and seventeenth century New England by a noted student of English history.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013; Francis J.Bremer, Coordinator, New England Beginnings and Author of <i>Lay Empowerment and the Development of Puritanism</i></b></p></p><h2>Voodoo in New Orleans</h2><p><p>"Straightforward handling of.. . voodooism in all its manifestations."<br>--Kirkus Reviews</p><p>Originally published in 1946, this intriguing book examines the rites and beliefs associated with voodoo through the legends of the art--its charms, trances, rituals, and difficult-to-explain occurrences.</p><p></p></p><p><p>"Robert Tallant speaks with authority. . . ."<br>--New York Times</p><p>"Straightforward handling of sensational times and tricksters, of the cult of voodooism in all its manifestations. From its first known appearances in New Orleans of 200 years ago, here are the . . . rites and dances, the cures, charms and gris-gris. Here were the witch-doctors and queens, and in particular Doctor John . . . and Marie Laveau."<br>--Kirkus Reviews</p><p>"Much nonsense has been written about voodoo in New Orleans. . . . Here is a truthful and definitive picture."<br>--Lyle Saxon</p><p>The word "voodoo" elicits reactions from fear to fascination; thoughts of pins stuck in dolls, hexes, and strange rites immediately come to mind. But few people know the true origin of voodooism or anything about its practice in America, particularly in New Orleans. This examination of voodoo rites and beliefs is sure to fascinate every reader.</p>ROBERT TALLANT (1909-1957) was one of Louisiana&#39;s best-known authors and a participant in the WPA Writers&#39; Project during the 1930s and 1940s. During the last years of his life, he was a lecturer in English at Newcomb College.</p><h2>The Churching of America, 1776-2005: Winners and Losers in Our Religious Economy</h2><p>Although many Americans assume that religious participation has declined in America, Finke and Stark present a different picture. In 1776, fewer than 1 in 5 Americans were active in church affairs. Today, church membership includes about 6 out of 10 people.<br><br> But, as Finke and Stark show, not all denominations benefited. They explain how and why the early nineteenth-century churches began their descent, while two newcomer sects, the Baptists and the Methodists, gained ground. They also analyze why the Methodists then began a long, downward slide, why the Baptists continued to succeed, how the Catholic Church met the competition of ardent Protestant missionaries, and why the Catholic commitment has declined since Vatican II. The authors also explain why ecumenical movements always fail<br><br> In short, Americans are not abandoning religion; they have been moving away from established denominations. A "church-sect process" is always under way, Finke and Stark argue, as successful churches lose their organizational vigor and are replaced by less worldly groups.<br><br> Some observers assert that the rise in churching rates indicates increased participation, not increased belief. Finke and Stark challenge this as well. They find that those groups that have gained the greatest numbers have demanded that their followers accept traditional doctrines and otherworldliness. They argue that religious organizations can thrive only when they comfort souls and demand sacrifice. When theology becomes too logical, or too secular, it loses people.</p><p>Rodney Stark was for many years professor of sociology and comparative religion at the University of Washington. In 2004 he became University Professor of the Social Sciences at Baylor University.</p><h2>Sisters Like Us (Mischief Bay, 4)</h2><p><strong>The grass is always greener on your sister&#x2019;s side of the fence...</strong><br><br>Divorce left Harper Szymanski with a name no one can spell, a house she can&#x2019;t afford and a teenage daughter who&#x2019;s pulling away. With her fledgling virtual-assistant business, she&#x2019;s scrambling to maintain her overbearing mother&#x2019;s ridiculous Susie Homemaker standards and still pay the bills, thanks to clients like Lucas, the annoying playboy cop who claims he hangs around for Harper&#x2019;s fresh-baked cookies.<br><br>Spending half her life in school hasn&#x2019;t prepared Dr. Stacey Bloom for her most daunting challenge&#x2014;motherhood. She didn&#x2019;t inherit the nurturing gene like Harper and is in deep denial that a baby is coming. Worse, her mother will be horrified to learn that Stacey&#x2019;s husband plans to be a stay-at-home dad...assuming Stacey can first find the courage to tell Mom she&#x2019;s already six months pregnant.<br><br>Separately they may be a mess, but together Harper and Stacey can survive anything&#x2014;their indomitable mother, overwhelming maternity stores and ex&#x2019;s weddings. <em>Sisters Like Us</em> is a delightful look at sisters, mothers and daughters in today&#x2019;s fast-paced world, told with Susan Mallery&#x2019;s trademark warmth and humor.</p><p>#1 NYT bestselling author Susan Mallery writes heartwarming, humorous novels about the relationships that define our lives&#x2015;family, friendship, romance.

But Robert J. Wicks says we all have the path to spirituality within us, if only we would follow it. <p>Everyday Simplicity helps us better recognize the everyday gestures of God and discover an inner peace and joy we can share with others. Wicks describes a spiritual life readily accessible to everyone. It requires opening our eyes, appreciating our lives as they are now, and developing a true sense of ourselves in the image and likeness of God. Wicks provides a clear explanation of how to develop this deeply-anchored inner life through his "little rule of prayer"--a set of practices that helps us broaden and deepen our spirituality. </p><p>Through this process we develop a better understanding of ourselves beyond the labels of the superficial world. And we become less needy and more open to people in an honest, rather than a manipulative manner. We develop a sense of freedom from the alienation and anxiety that so often clouds our awareness of a spiritual presence in our lives. It takes patience and effort to achieve a truly satisfying spiritual life. Everyday Simplicity offers a months worth of reflections, questions, suggestions and prayers to guide us on the journey. </p><p>It begins with recognizing the spiritual element in every moment and being open to new knowledge and experiences. Everyday Simplicity does not offer a simple path to enlightenment, nor does it promise a quick fix to external burdens accumulated over time. It simply shares one way to understand God--and by extension, ourselves--through daily, prayerful reflection that helps keep the apparently complex problems of our lives in proper perspective.</p></p><p>A solid spiritual life is within everyone's reach . . .<p>it's not that complicated.</p><p>Getting a life of any kind is hard enough in a world that has us going around in circles -- from the stresses of our workplace to the demands of home and back again tomorrow.</p><p>Getting a spiritual life can seem like a luxury to be put off to another, quieter time.</p><p>Robert Wicks, however, believes that the search for a spiritual life begins not in some exotic, unreachable place, but right where we are -- in the midst of all the craziness.</p><p>It starts within our busy, stressed-out human hearts, not in some other "more spiritual" place.</p><p>The more we are able, therefore, to be our true selves, the more successful we will be in developing a spirituality that will be real and satisfying.</p><p>Here's solid, common sense advice on how to get a spiritual life -- no matter how busy your day.</p>Robert Wicks helps the helpers. People such as physicians, teachers, psychologists and ministers, who give until they may not be able to help themselves. Wicks assists them "in integrating the psychological and the spiritual so people can extend their emotional flames to others without burning out in the process." <p>Specializing in the secondary stress disorder commonly called burnout, Wicks strives to open exhausted givers to the miracle of receiving. He accomplishes this by marrying sound psychology and basic spiritual truths that, in turn, sets the stage for profound personal transformation. </p><p>Besides ministering around the globe--from the psychological debriefing of relief workers evacuated to the United States from Rwanda to conducting workshops in Cambodia for members of the international community assigned to help the Khmer people rebuild their nation--Wicks has written more than 30 books, including Touching the Holy:Ordinariness, Self-Esteem, and Friendship; After 50:Spiritually Embracing Your Own Wisdom Years; and Sharing Wisdom. He is the editor of the Handbook of Spirituality for Ministers, and serves as a professor and chairperson of the graduate programs in pastoral counseling at Loyola College, Baltimore. </p><p>Wicks, a Queens, New York native, received a masters in clinical psychology in 1973 from St. Johns University and a doctorate in psychology from Philadelphias Hahnemann Medical College in 1977. In 1996, Pope John Paul II awarded Wicks a papal medal for his service to the Catholic Church. </p><p>Wicks and his wife Michaele have a grown daughter. They live in suburban Baltimore.</p></p><h2>Nutritious Delicious: Turbocharge Your Favorite Recipes with 50 Everyday Superfoods</h2><p>A simple approach to amping up the nutrition in our cooking, Nutritious Delicious focuses on 50 everyday superfoods among vegetables and fruit, grains, and proteins, and uses them as the basis for building more nutrient-packed versions of the dishes we love for every meal of the day.</p><p>America&#x2019;s Test Kitchen is well-known for its top-rated television shows with more than 4 million weekly public television viewers, bestselling cookbooks, magazines, websites, and cooking school.

The only anthology of short-short stories to focus on youth.</strong></p> In these stories of no more than 1000 words, well-known and emerging American authors spotlight crucial moments of change during coming-of-age. Their young protagonists face matters of great consequence, such as the death of a parent, unwanted pregnancy, and bullying, as well as lighter, if perplexing circumstances: how to hold a prom when being home-schooled; what to do when the babysitter suddenly sees the Rapture. The stories are of this moment--a girl who falls in love and then is pressured to lose her virginity in a cyberspace world--and they also remember the past: the Nixon era, the Vietnam War, slavery.

Yet the country's national politics have historically included all those features. In American Political History: A Very Short Introduction, Donald Critchlow takes on this contradiction between original theory and actual practice. This brief, accessible book explores the nature of the two-party system, key turning points in American political history, representative presidential and congressional elections, struggles to expand the electorate, and critical social protest and third-party movements. The volume emphasizes the continuity of a liberal tradition challenged by partisan divide, war, and periodic economic turmoil.<br><br>American Political History: A Very Short Introduction explores the emergence of a democratic political culture within a republican form of government, showing the mobilization and extension of the mass electorate over the lifespan of the country. In a nation characterized by great racial, ethnic, and religious diversity, American democracy has proven extraordinarily durable. Individual parties have risen and fallen, but the dominance of the two-party system persists. Fierce debates over the meaning of the U.S. Constitution have created profound divisions within the parties and among voters, but a belief in the importance of constitutional order persists among political leaders and voters. Americans have been deeply divided about the extent of federal power, slavery, the meaning of citizenship, immigration policy, civil rights, and a range of economic, financial, and social policies. New immigrants, racial minorities, and women have joined the electorate and the debates. But American political history, with its deep social divisions, bellicose rhetoric, and antagonistic partisanship provides valuable lessons about the meaning and viability of democracy in the early 21st century.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

I must admit that fictional Carl is much better behaved than real-life Carl, with or without golf balls.</p><p><b>One</b></p><p><b>Kelly</b> Flynn nosed her car onto the gravel driveway and pulled to a stop in front of the familiar little house perched beside a golf course. Everything looked the same. Aunt Helen&#x2019;s beige stucco, red tile-roofed cottage looked as cozy and inviting as always. Golfers were scattered about the lush greens, doggedly working to improve their games. In the background the Colorado Rocky Mountains, still snow-capped in late spring, loomed over the entire scene. It was all picture-postcard pretty, just like Kelly remembered, except for one thing. Aunt Helen was dead&#x2014;murdered a week ago in her picturesque cottage.</p><p>A &#x201c;burglary gone bad&#x201d; the police called it. Kelly&#x2019;s gut still twisted at the thought. Aunt Helen would have fought back. Kelly knew she would. Even though she was thin as a stick and a foot shorter than Kelly, she was wiry and tough. And she had spirit. Spunk. She&#x2019;d never go down without a fight. Not Aunt Helen. No way.</p><p>Kelly felt tears rise to her eyes again as she remembered her aunt&#x2019;s favorite admonition: &#x201c;Never give up, Kelly-girl. If you want something bad enough, don&#x2019;t you ever give up.&#x201d; The tears escaped, running down Kelly&#x2019;s cheeks, and she swiped them away with the back of her hand. She&#x2019;d never even had the chance to say good-bye. At least with her dad, Kelly&#x2019;d been able to tell him how much she loved him. Cancer might be an ugly way to die, but it was slower. Murder was a thief in the night, creeping in to steal away valuable loved ones. And this thief stole the only mother Kelly had ever known.</p><p>A cold, wet nose shoved against Kelly&#x2019;s neck, and she turned to pat the shiny black Rottweiler head resting beside her shoulder. Carl always sensed her moods. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, boy, I haven&#x2019;t forgotten you. You&#x2019;re looking at that grass, right?&#x201d; She pointed to the manicured golf course, stretching from her aunt&#x2019;s property all the way to the river that meandered diagonally through the scenic college town north of Denver.</p><p>Kelly let herself gaze. It had been six months since she&#x2019;d returned to Fort Connor, where she spent her early childhood. Every time she returned, she wondered how she&#x2019;d ever make herself leave again. The sky was bluer here, the air was cleaner, and the sun was brighter by a mile. &#x201c;A mile high to be exact,&#x201d; as Aunt Helen used to say. What a gorgeous day. If her aunt was still alive, she and Kelly would take one of their favorite hikes along a trail in the nearby Poudre Canyon. How could it be so beautiful with Helen gone?</p><p>Carl whined to get her attention, clearly eager to explore. &#x201c;Okay, boy, but you can&#x2019;t run on the course. The greenskeeper wouldn&#x2019;t appreciate your lifting a leg on every tee.&#x201d; Carl rolled his soft brown eyes to her in pleading mode.</p><p>&#x201c;Nope. You&#x2019;ll just have to make do with the yard.&#x201d; Kelly opened the car door and slid out, grabbing a leash as she did.</p><p>Carl&#x2019;s ears perked up at the magic jingle, and he gave an excited yelp. That meant outside and play. Snapping the leash to his red collar, Kelly headed toward the small backyard. Tall cottonwood trees surrounded the property, shading both house and yard. Flower boxes were already planted, even though Kelly knew the frost date in northern Colorado was a yearly gamble. Somehow, Helen always won out. Her green thumb or gardener&#x2019;s luck could overcome even Colorado&#x2019;s capricious weather.</p><p>Kelly made a mental note to water the plants that evening. She wasn&#x2019;t about to let Helen&#x2019;s plants die with her. She swung the back gate open and ushered Carl inside. &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t the golf course, boy, but it&#x2019;s bigger than your yard for sure,&#x201d; she said, referring to her postage stamp- size townhouse yard on the outskirts of Washington, D.C. Carl didn&#x2019;t waste time. He took off the moment his leash was unsnapped, nose to the ground.</p><p>The sound of another car coming down the gravel driveway caught Kelly&#x2019;s attention, and she turned to see a red minivan drive up to the larger stucco and red tile- roofed house across the drive. A woman exited the van and entered the sprawling mirror-image of Helen&#x2019;s cottage.</p><p>Both houses and the assorted outbuildings nearby occupied a pie-shaped wedge of land that clung to the corner of a busy intersection. Kelly remembered when both streets were country roads cutting through fields of sugar beets and sheep farms. Now, a big box discount store swallowed the opposite corner and townhouses clustered across the street.</p><p>At least her aunt and uncle had sold their farmland to the city for a golf course and kept only the cottage and its yard. If she squinted her eyes hard enough, Kelly could block out the golfers and picture her uncle heading to the barn years ago when he was still alive.</p><p>&#x201c;Kelly, is that you?&#x201d; a woman&#x2019;s voice called.</p><p>Kelly shut the gate, knowing Carl would be occupied for hours identifying scents. She turned and recognized Mimi Shafer walking across the driveway. Mimi owned the knitting and needlework shop that now occupied what was once Aunt Helen&#x2019;s and Uncle Jim&#x2019;s farmhouse. Her aunt had been ecstatic about the arrangement, since she was an expert knitter and quilter, but Kelly had always felt vaguely resentful. She remembered when the house was filled with Aunt Helen and Uncle Jim&#x2014;and memories. But Uncle Jim&#x2019;s long illness changed all that.</p><p>Now, Kelly felt nothing but gratitude. Mimi had been Aunt Helen&#x2019;s closest friend and had never left Kelly&#x2019;s side during yesterday&#x2019;s service. She gave names to faces and helped Kelly stand and sit through a liturgy that was no longer familiar.</p><p>Kelly straightened her white blouse and navy skirt. Not as tailored as her usual CPA firm attire, but sober enough for a lawyer meeting. She couldn&#x2019;t wait until she could change into a casual top and slacks, maybe even shorts if it stayed warm. Ever since she got back, she&#x2019;d been dressed up and meeting people. Just like the office. But Colorado meant sunshine and mountains and freedom to Kelly. And that meant shorts, a T-shirt, and sneakers.</p><p>She brushed her chin-length dark-brown hair behind her ear and checked the barrette in back. Kelly&#x2019;d rushed through her shower and dressing in order to fit in a morning run along the trail that ran beside the motel. She&#x2019;d barely checked the mirror. After yesterday&#x2019;s tears, she needed to clear her head. Running always helped her think.</p><p>She waved to Mimi. &#x201c;I just thought I&#x2019;d let Carl use Helen&#x2019;s backyard today while I go to all those . . . you know, meetings. Lawyer, banker, and all that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a great idea. I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s tired of being cooped up in the motel room,&#x201d; Mimi said with a bright smile. Her sun-streaked brown hair feathered softly around her face. Fiftyish, slender, and pretty, she wore a powder-blue straight dress that accentuated her trim figure. But what really drew Kelly&#x2019;s attention was the open-weave vest she wore on top; the loosely fixed knots held the yarns together. Varying shades of blue traveled all the way to green and back again. The effect was stunning.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have time for a cup of tea or coffee?&#x201d; Mimi asked, obviously hoping for a yes.</p><p>Kelly hesitated, running through her mental daytimer. That and the Greenwich Meridian time clock in her head kept Kelly on task. She depended on that clock. Back in the firm, everyone kept track of their time in tenths of an hour&#x2014;six-minute intervals&#x2014;billable hours. Consequently, Kelly was seldom late. &#x201c;I have a few minutes. My appointment with the lawyer isn&#x2019;t until ten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, darn, I was hoping we&#x2019;d have more time,&#x201d; Mimi said, her smile momentarily missing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been dying to show you the shop, but I guess it&#x2019;ll just have to wait until later today. Why don&#x2019;t we step over to the caf�?&#x201d; She gestured toward the pathway leading around the farmhouse.</p><p>Kelly completely forgot that a bistro-style caf� had opened in the former kitchen and dining room of the farmhouse since her last visit. As they followed the flower beds and flagstone path, Kelly was astonished to see the caf� also spilled out into the shady backyard. Surrounded by high stucco walls, the entire patio was private, secluded from the outside. The whole setting was delightful and charming, Kelly had to admit.</p><p>Mimi chose a table and sat down, motioning to a nearby waitress as Kelly settled into a wrought-iron chair. &#x201c;This is really quite nice. I like what they&#x2019;ve done here,&#x201d; Kelly surprised herself by saying. Noticing the many tables filled with customers lingering over late breakfasts and brunch, she asked, &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it doing? Financially, I mean. I know how hard it is for small restaurants to make it.&#x201d; As a beginning accountant years ago, Kelly had had several restaurants to worry about. &#x201c;Shoe box clients&#x201d; she used to call them, because they always kept their accounts in shoe boxes for some reason.</p><p>&#x201c;Actually, quite well, according to Pete,&#x201d; said Mimi. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the young man who had the idea of turning this whole area into a restaurant. Somehow, he managed to convince the management company that owns it to invest in used equipment, and he volunteered all the labor. He put his heart and soul into this place.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope all that hard work hasn&#x2019;t been wasted . . . for both of us.&#x201d;</p><p>Intrigued by the cryptic remark, Kelly was about to respond when the waitress appeared. She had shoulder-length reddish-brown hair that curved around a pretty face. &#x201c;Hi, Mimi,&#x201d; she said with a bright smile, then turned a warm gaze to Kelly.</p><p>&#x201c;Kelly, this is Jennifer Stroud,&#x201d; Mimi introduced. &#x201c;She was also a friend of Helen&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Kelly, I just wanted to say how shocked we were at Helen&#x2019;s death. She was a wonderful lady. I used to see her over at the shop almost every day, and she was always so sweet and loving. We&#x2019;ll all miss her a lot.&#x201d;</p><p>The comments caught Kelly unprepared, and she felt her eyes grow suddenly moist. She glanced down at her napkin. &#x201c;Thank you. You&#x2019;re very kind.&#x201d;</p><p>Jennifer reached out and patted Kelly&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s okay. Let me bring you something. I know Mimi&#x2019;s order already. Earl Grey, cream. How about you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coffee, black and strong,&#x201d; Kelly said with a smile, which helped chase away the tears.</p><p>&#x201c;Down with decaf, right?&#x201d; Jennifer winked as she flipped the notepad closed. &#x201c;Be right back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think she was at the funeral yesterday, but I really can&#x2019;t remember too much,&#x201d; Kelly said as she watched Jennifer skirt between tables, glad for the chance to compose herself.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes, she was there with the other knitting shop regulars.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Regulars?&#x201d; Kelly asked, &#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got lots of knitting and needlework groups that meet regularly at the shop during the week. Some are organized, some just happen, like Jennifer&#x2019;s group. They&#x2019;re a bunch of women, many of whom are around your age, who meet after work a couple of times a week or more. Of course, anybody who shows up is welcome to sit in with any group. That&#x2019;s how Helen met Jennifer and the others.&#x201d;</p><p>Kelly could easily picture that. Helen was always knitting, and loved nothing better than to share her passion.

The story is told through the experiences of a Native American Nipmuc man who fights to change the future, while coming to terms with his own troubled past and the acceptance of his family. For Neempau, the ultimate remedy is to challenge and end one of America's favorite holidays: Thanksgiving.His heart-wrenching, daring, and sometimes humorous journey not only exposes the innermost core of Native American struggles, but also the complexities of the notion of race, tradition, and identity.This brilliant story transcends cultural differences and inspires new thinking while taking readers beyond the boundaries of the past.</p><h2>Zen Poems (Everyman&#39;s Library Pocket Poets Series)</h2><p>The appreciation of Zen philosophy and art has become universal, and Zen poetry, with its simple expression of direct, intuitive insight and sudden enlightenment, appeals to lovers of poetry, spirituality, and beauty everywhere.

He challenges African Americans to consider the incorporation of Marxism into their theological perspectives, thereby adopting the mindset that it is class more so than race that renders one powerless in America. Armed with a new introduction by the author, this Twentieth Anniversary Edition of <i>Prophesy Deliverance!</i> is a must have.</p></p><p><b>Cornel West</b> is Class of 1943 University Professor in the Center for African American Studies at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. He is considered one of America's most provocative public individuals and has been a champion for racial justice since childhood. His writing, speaking, and teaching weave together the traditions of the black Baptist church, progressive politics, and jazz. The <i>New York Times</i> has praised his "ferocious moral vision."</p><h2>The Book of the Damned: The Original Classic of Paranormal Exploration</h2><p><b>The signature edition of Charles Fort's classic of paranormal discovery--reset with a new index.</b><br><br>Welcome to a record of the damned. "By damned," wrote Charles Fort in 1919, "I mean the excluded. We shall have a procession of the data that Science has excluded."<br><br>Fort's record of the unknown was one of the first to expose us to visitors from space, monsters, poltergeists, and floating islands. Frogs fall from the sky. Mysterious airships take flight in an age before the airplane. People disappear, reappear, and spontaneously combust. <br><br>This stand-alone, handsome edition exposes today's readers to the core work of Fort's extraordinary career--in which he pushed us to ask: What is out there?</p><p>Born in Albany, New York, on August 6, 1874, <b>CHARLES FORT</b> made his life's work the study of unexplained phenomena. After achieving modest success as a short story writer and novelist, Fort began studying anomalous phenomena. In 1919 he published his landmark of paranormal exploration, <i>The Book of the Damned</i>, which influenced generations of writers. Fort moved to London in 1924 to consult the archives at the British Museum, then returned to the United States in 1926. At the New York Public Library he continued his research into spontaneous combustion, space ships, poltergeists, and other experiences and events that had been written off by science. Fort published three additional books on the unexplained: <i>New Lands</i> (1923),<i> Lo!</i> (1931), and <i>Wild Talents </i>(1932).&nbsp; Though his work attracted controversy, Fort was celebrated in <i>The New York Times </i>as "the <i>enfant terrible</i> of science" and he counted novelist Theodore Dreiser among his closest friends and literary admirers. Fort's name was made into an adjective--<i>fortean</i>--to describe strange phenomena. A lasting influence on the evolution of science fiction as well as science, Fort stands as one of the most fascinating and polarizing figures in all of Americana. He died on May 3, 1932, in New York City.<p></p><p>CONTENTS</p><p><i>The Tarcher Cornerstone Editions</i></p><p><i>Title Page</i></p><p><i>Copyright</i></p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p><i>Index</i></p><p><i>About the Author</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>A procession of the damned.</p><p>By the damned, I mean the excluded.</p><p>We shall have a procession of data that Science has excluded.</p><p>Battalions of the accursed, captained by pallid data that I have exhumed, will march.

I think we&#x2019;re all bugs and mice, and are only different expressions of an all-inclusive cheese.</p><p>Or that red is not positively different from yellow: is only another degree of whatever vibrancy yellow is a degree of: that red and yellow are continuous, or that they merge in orange.</p><p>So then that, if, upon the basis of yellowness and redness, Science should attempt to classify all phenomena, including all red things as veritable, and excluding all yellow things as false or illusory, the demarcation would have to be false and arbitrary, because things colored orange, constituting continuity, would belong on both sides of the attempted border-line.</p><p>As we go along, we shall be impressed with this:</p><p>That no basis for classification, or inclusion and exclusion, more reasonable than that of redness and yellowness has ever been conceived of.</p><p>Science has, by appeal to various bases, included a multitude of data. Had it not done so, there would be nothing with which to seem to be. Science has, by appeal to various bases, excluded a multitude of data. Then, if redness is continuous with yellowness: if every basis of admission is continuous with every basis of exclusion, Science must have excluded some things that are continuous with the accepted. In redness and yellowness, which merge in orangeness, we typify all tests, all standards, all means of forming an opinion&#x2014;</p><p>Or that any positive opinion upon any subject is illusion built upon the fallacy that there are positive differences to judge by&#x2014;</p><p>That the quest of all intellection has been for something&#x2014;a fact, a basis, a generalization, law, formula, a major premise that is positive: that the best that has ever been done has been to say that some things are self-evident&#x2014;whereas, by evidence we mean the support of something else&#x2014;</p><p>That this is the quest; but that it has never been attained; but that Science has acted, ruled, pronounced, and condemned as if it had been attained.</p><p>What is a house?</p><p>It is not possible to say what anything is, as positively distinguished from anything else, if there are no positive differences.</p><p>A barn is a house, if one lives in it. If residence constitutes houseness, because style of architecture does not, then a bird&#x2019;s nest is a house: and human occupancy is not the standard to judge by, because we speak of dogs&#x2019; houses; nor material, because we speak of snow houses of Eskimos&#x2014;or a shell is a house to a hermit crab&#x2014;or was to the mollusk that made it&#x2014;or things seemingly so positively different as the White House at Washington and a shell on the seashore are seen to be continuous.</p><p>So no one has ever been able to say what electricity is, for instance. It isn&#x2019;t anything, as positively distinguished from heat or magnetism or life. Metaphysicians and theologians and biologists have tried to define life. They have failed, because, in a positive sense, there is nothing to define: there is no phenomenon of life that is not, to some degree, manifest in chemism, magnetism, astronomic motions.</p><p>White coral islands in a dark blue sea.</p><p>Their seeming of distinctness: the seeming of individuality, or of positive difference one from another&#x2014;but all are only projections from the same sea bottom. The difference between sea and land is not positive. In all water there is some earth: in all earth there is some water.</p><p>So then that all seeming things are not things at all, if all are inter-continuous, any more than is the leg of a table a thing in itself, if it is only a projection from something else: that not one of us is a real person, if, physically, we&#x2019;re continuous with environment; if, psychically, there is nothing to us but expression of relation to environment.</p><p>Our general expression has two aspects:</p><p>Conventional monism, or that all &#x201c;things&#x201d; that seem to have identity of their own are only islands that are projections from something underlying, and have no real outlines of their own.</p><p>But that all &#x201c;things,&#x201d; though only projections, are projections that are striving to break away from the underlying that denies them identity of their own.</p><p>I conceive of one inter-continuous nexus, in which and of which all seeming things are only different expressions, but in which all things are localizations of one attempt to break away and become real things, or to establish entity or positive difference or final demarcation or unmodified independence&#x2014;or personality or soul, as it is called in human phenomena&#x2014;</p><p>That anything that tries to establish itself as a real, or positive, or absolute system, government, organization, self, soul, entity, individuality, can so attempt only by drawing a line about itself, or about the inclusions that constitute itself, and damning or excluding, or breaking away from, all other &#x201c;things&#x201d;:</p><p>That, if it does not so act, it cannot seem to be;</p><p>That, if it does so act, it falsely and arbitrarily and futilely and disastrously acts, just as would one who draws a circle in the sea, including a few waves, saying that the other waves, with which the included are continuous, are positively different, and stakes his life upon maintaining that the admitted and the damned are positively different.</p><p>Our expression is that our whole existence is animation of the local by an ideal that is realizable only in the universal:</p><p>That, if all exclusions are false, because always are included and excluded continuous: that if all seeming of existence perceptible to us is the product of exclusion, there is nothing that is perceptible to us that really is: that only the universal can really be.</p><p>Our especial interest is in modern science as a manifestation of this one ideal or purpose or process:</p><p>That it has falsely excluded, because there are no positive standards to judge by: that it has excluded things that, by its own pseudo-standards, have as much right to come in as have the chosen.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>OUR GENERAL EXPRESSION:</p><p>That the state that is commonly and absurdly called &#x201c;existence,&#x201d; is a flow, or a current, or an attempt, from negativeness to positiveness, and is intermediate to both.</p><p>By positiveness we mean:</p><p>Harmony, equilibrium, order, regularity, stability, consistency, unity, realness, system, government, organization, liberty, independence, soul, self, personality, entity, individuality, truth, beauty, justice, perfection, definiteness&#x2014;</p><p>That all that is called development, progress, or evolution is movement toward, or attempt toward, this state for which, or for aspects of which, there are so many names, all of which are summed up in the one word &#x201c;positiveness.&#x201d;</p><p>At first this summing up may not be very readily acceptable. At first it may seem that all these words are not synonyms: that &#x201c;harmony&#x201d; may mean &#x201c;order,&#x201d; but that by &#x201c;independence,&#x201d; for instance, we do not mean &#x201c;truth,&#x201d; or that by &#x201c;stability&#x201d; we do not mean &#x201c;beauty,&#x201d; or &#x201c;system,&#x201d; or &#x201c;justice.&#x201d;</p><p>I conceive of one inter-continuous nexus, which expresses itself in astronomic phenomena, and chemic, biologic, psychic, sociologic: that it is everywhere striving to localize positiveness: that to this attempt in various fields of phenomena&#x2014;which are only quasi-different&#x2014;we give different names. We speak of the &#x201c;system&#x201d; of the planets, and not of their &#x201c;government&#x201d;: but in considering a store, for instance, and its management, we see that the words are interchangeable. It used to be customary to speak of chemic equilibrium, but not of social equilibrium: that false demarcation has been broken down. We shall see that by all these words we mean the same state. As every-day conveniences, or in terms of common illusions, of course, they are not synonyms. To a child an earth worm is not an animal. It is to the biologist.</p><p>By &#x201c;beauty,&#x201d; I mean that which seems complete.</p><p>Obversely, that the incomplete, or the mutilated, is the ugly.</p><p>Venus de Milo.</p><p>To a child she is ugly.</p><p>When a mind adjusts to thinking of her as a completeness, even though, by physiologic standards, incomplete, she is beautiful.</p><p>A hand thought of only as a hand, may seem beautiful.</p><p>Found on a battlefield&#x2014;obviously a part&#x2014;not beautiful.</p><p>But everything in our experience is only a part of something else that in turn is only a part of still something else&#x2014;or that there is nothing beautiful in our experience: only appearances that are intermediate to beauty and ugliness&#x2014;that only universality is complete: that only the complete is the beautiful: that every attempt to achieve beauty is an attempt to give to the local the attribute of the universal.</p><p>By stability, we mean the immovable and the unaffected. But all seeming things are only reactions to something else. Stability, too, then, can be only the universal, or that besides which there is nothing else. Though some things seem to have&#x2014;or have&#x2014;higher approximations to stability than have others, there are, in our experience, only various degrees of intermediateness to stability and instability. Every man, then, who works for stability under its various names of &#x201c;permanency,&#x201d; &#x201c;survival,&#x201d; duration,&#x201d; is striving to localize in something the state that is realizable only in the universal.</p><p>By independence, entity, and individuality, I can mean only that besides which there is nothing else, if given only two things, they must be continuous and mutually affective, if everything is only a reaction to something else, and any two things would be destructive of each other&#x2019;s independence, entity, or individuality.</p><p>All attempted organizations and systems and consistencies, some approximating far higher than others, but all only intermediate to Order and Disorder, fail eventually because of their relations with outside forces. All are attempted completenesses. If to all local phenomena there are always outside forces, these attempts, too, are realizable only in the state of completeness, or that to which there are no outside forces.</p><p>Or that all these words are synonyms, all meaning the state that we call the positive state&#x2014;</p><p>That our whole &#x201c;existence&#x201d; is a striving for the positive state.</p><p>The amazing paradox of it all:</p><p>That all things are trying to become the universal by excluding other things.</p><p>That there is only this one process, and that it does animate all expressions, in all fields of phenomena, of that which we think of as one inter-continuous nexus:</p><p>The religious and their idea or ideal of the soul. They mean distinct, stable entity, or a state that is independent, and not a mere flux of vibrations or complex of reactions to environment, continuous with environment, merging away with an infinitude of other interdependent complexes.</p><p>But the only thing that would not merge away into something else would be that besides which there is nothing else.</p><p>That Truth is only another name for the positive state, or that the quest for Truth is the attempt to achieve positiveness:</p><p>Scientists who have thought that they were seeking Truth, but who were trying to find out astronomic, or chemic, or biologic truths. But Truth is that besides which there is nothing: nothing to modify it, nothing to question it, nothing to form an exception: the all-inclusive, the complete&#x2014;</p><p>By Truth I mean the Universal.</p><p>So chemists have sought the true, or the real, and have always failed in their endeavors, because of the outside relations of chemical phenomena: have failed in the sense that never has a chemical law, without exceptions, been discovered: because chemistry is continuous with astronomy, phys...</p></p><h2>Dragon Haven (The Rain Wild Chronicles, Book 2)</h2><p><p>Return to the world of the Liveships Traders and journey along the Rain Wild River in the second instalment of high adventure from the author of the internationally acclaimed Farseer trilogy.</p><p>A mythical city: a dangerous quest...</p><p>As the fledgling dragons and their keepers forge a passage through the uncharted waters of the Rain Wild River, they are supported by the liveship Tarman, its captain, Leftrin, and Alise Finbok, who has escaped her cruel marriage in Bingtown.</p><p>A vial of dragon blood can earn a man enough gold to last a lifetime: there may be some in the party who see the dragons as more valuable as body parts than whole and alive.

His dark and unsettling short stories and novels were shaped in large part by personal experience and his work evokes a disturbing sense of the amorphous and horrific unknown. <br><br> While his adventure fiction was very popular during his lifetime, the supernatural and cosmic horror he is most remembered for only became well known after his death, mainly due to the efforts of writers like H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith, who often praised his work and cited it as an influence on their own. By the latter half of the twentieth century, it was only his weird fiction that remained in print, and his vast catalog of non-supernatural stories was extremely hard to find. <br><br> Night Shade Books&#x2019;s five-volume series presents all of Hodgson&#x2019;s unique and timeless fiction. Each volume contains one of Hodgson's novels, along with a selection of thematically-linked short fiction, including a number of works reprinted for the first time since their original publication. The second of the five-volume set, The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places, collects Hodgson&#x2019;s mystery and suspense fiction, including those starring the occult detective Thomas Carnacki, and the titular novel The House on the Borderland, a seminal and influential work of early weird fiction. <br><br><b>The Complete Fiction of William Hope Hodgson is published by Night Shade Books in the following volumes:</b><br><i>The Boats of the &#x201c;Glen Carrig&#x201d; and Other Nautical Adventures</i><br><i>The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places</i><br><i>The Ghost Pirates and Other Revenants of the Sea</i><br><i>The Night Land and Other Romances</i><br><i>The Dream of X and Other Fantastic Visions</i></p><p>This classic novel of the weird supernatural, first published in 1908, was an important influence on H. P. Lovecraft. In the ruins of an ancient stone house in Ireland is found the diary of an elderly man who lived alone with his sister and their pets, and who longed for his lost love. The diary tells of how the man explores a cyclopean cavern beneath the house and fights off swarms of white pig-like monsters pouring up from below. Then, in a visionary sequence, he breaks through to an alternate space-time dimension and sees a doppelganger of his house on a vast desolate plain. The prose is hokey at times, but the strange mood evoked by the other-dimensional setting is powerful indeed. As acclaimed horror writer T. E. D. Klein says, &#34;Never has a book so hauntingly conveyed a sense of terrible loneliness and isolation.&#34;William Hope Hodgson was an early twentieth-century English author who produced a large and critically acclaimed body of short fiction and novels spanning several overlapping genres, including horror, fantastic fiction, and science fiction. Hodgson was killed in action in WWI in 1918, at the age of forty.</p><h2>The Permaculture City: Regenerative Design for Urban, Suburban, and Town Resilience</h2><p><p>Permaculture is more than just the latest buzzword; it offers positive solutions for many of the environmental and social challenges confronting us. And nowhere are those remedies more needed and desired than in our cities. <em>The Permaculture City</em> provides a new way of thinking about urban living, with practical examples for creating abundant food, energy security, close-knit communities, local and meaningful livelihoods, and sustainable policies in our cities and towns. The same nature-based approach that works so beautifully for growing food&#x2015;connecting the pieces of the landscape together in harmonious ways&#x2015;applies perfectly to many of our other needs. Toby Hemenway, one of the leading practitioners and teachers of permaculture design, illuminates a new way forward through examples of edge-pushing innovations, along with a deeply holistic conceptual framework for our cities, towns, and suburbs.<br> <br> <em>The Permaculture City</em> begins in the garden but takes what we have learned there and applies it to a much broader range of human experience; we&#x2019;re not just gardening plants but people, neighborhoods, and even cultures. Hemenway lays out how permaculture design can help towndwellers solve the challenges of meeting our needs for food, water, shelter, energy, community, and livelihood in sustainable, resilient ways. Readers will find new information on designing the urban home garden and strategies for gardening in community, rethinking our water and energy systems, learning the difference between a &#x201c;job&#x201d; and a &#x201c;livelihood,&#x201d; and the importance of placemaking and an empowered community.<br> <br> This important book documents the rise of a new sophistication, depth, and diversity in the approaches and thinking of permaculture designers and practitioners. Understanding nature can do more than improve how we grow, make, or consume things; it can also teach us how to cooperate, make decisions, and arrive at good solutions.</p></p><p><p>Toby Hemenway was the author of the first major North American book on permaculture,&nbsp;<em>Gaia&#x2019;s Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>The Permaculture City</em>. After obtaining a degree in biology from Tufts University, Toby worked for many years as a researcher in genetics and immunology, first in academic laboratories at Harvard and the University of Washington in Seattle, and then at Immunex, a major medical biotech company. At about the time he was growing dissatisfied with the direction biotechnology was taking, he discovered permaculture, a design approach based on ecological principles that creates sustainable landscapes, homes, and workplaces. A career change followed, and Toby and his wife spent ten years creating a rural permaculture site in southern Oregon. He was associate editor of&nbsp;<em>Permaculture Activist</em>, a journal of ecological design and sustainable culture, from 1999 to 2004. He taught permaculture and consulted and lectured on ecological design throughout the country, and his writing appeared in magazines such as&nbsp;<em>Whole Earth Review</em>,&nbsp;<em>Natural Home</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Kitchen Gardener</em>. Toby passed away in 2016.</p> <p>Visit his web site at&nbsp;www.patternliteracy.com</p><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>-</strong></p> <p>"For the past six years, Hemenway&#x2019;s acclaimed first book, <em>Gaia&#x2019;s Garden </em>(2009), has been the world&#x2019;s best-selling guidebook on home and garden permaculture. He now continues to champion this environmental philosophy that involves working with nature, instead of against it, for maximum sustainability. Although permaculture practices originally began with small-scale farms and gardens in mind, in his latest work Hemenway presents a much larger vision of applying them to metropolitan settings. In what is more than simply a handbook on finding space to grow fruits and vegetables in the concrete jungle, the author demonstrates just how widely the permaculture net can be cast by including advice on sustainably managing critical urban resources such as water, shelter, electricity, and even community centers. After introductory chapters on permaculture principles and the history and evolution of cities, Hemenway covers the basics of designing urban home gardens before moving on to discuss &#x201c;water wisdom&#x201d; and home energy solutions. An invaluable resource for city planners and dwellers alike, as well as an optimistic exploration of the possibilities for ecological well-being in our future urban landscapes.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Library Journal</em>-</strong></p> <p>"Permaculture refers to a method of agricultural design that uses natural approaches. While several chapters address the unique challenges and opportunities in creating an urban garden, Hemenway refers often to his first book,&nbsp;<em>Gaia&#x2019;s Garden</em>, the initial major volume published in North America on permaculture principles, for further detail. Here, the author&#x2019;s focus narrows to an urban setting, where permaculture means more than having a sustainable garden but can generate powerful change and community growth. Combining anecdotal stories of local U.S. neighborhoods practicing permaculture principles with black-and-white and color photos, Hemenway describes ways in which urban dwellers can not only create their own backyard oasis but join with their neighbors to build shared spaces in which to produce food, culture, and identity. Valuable tips on water conservation via rain harvesting and graywater collection mingle with advice on reducing energy consumption, producing local energy resources, and decreasing your foodshed and carbon footprints. Notes and index provide a reliable reference for further reading.&nbsp;VERDICT:&nbsp;An enlightening read for anyone interested in green gardening, environmental ethics, social justice issues, and seeking positive community change.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em>-</strong></p> <p>"This eagerly awaited book from West Coast permaculture expert Hemenway, author of the classic&nbsp;<em>Gaia's Garden</em>, pushes permaculture design beyond its usual realm of homesteading and gardening, applying it to the complex systems that make up contemporary urban life. Other permaculturalists are also exploring these ideas, but Hemenway's intelligent, down-to-earth analyses, astute systems thinking, and clear organization offer a particularly comprehensive, open-ended, and sophisticated yet understandable overview to readers who want to discover, evaluate, utilize, and integrate the untapped resources abundant in any city or town. Hemenway focuses on the philosophical, &#x2018;whetting appetites' and providing toolkits rather than in-depth instruction, with the goal of teaching readers 'to become adept at a whole-systems approach to living in and finding solutions in cities, towns, and suburbs.' Referencing livable-city innovators such as Jane Jacobs and human-scale design thinkers such as Christopher Alexander, Hemenway shows how permaculture concepts can be stretched and rethought in an urban setting to include not just one's house, garden, and yard but also neighbors, parks, and city agencies.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>"Many people who are searching for a more fulfilling life, wanting to reduce their ecological footprint and build resilience for uncertain futures, grasp that permaculture might be part of the solution but are often unsure how it applies to their particular situation. For residents of towns and cities in the modern affluent world,&nbsp;<em>The Permaculture City&nbsp;</em>shows how permaculture design makes common sense."<strong>--David Holmgren, co-originator of the Permaculture concept</strong></p><br><br><p>"Toby Hemenway&#x2019;s&nbsp;<em>Gaia&#x2019;s Garden</em>&nbsp;is the go-to book I always recommend for those interested in permaculture. His new book,&nbsp;<em>The Permaculture City,</em>&nbsp;is the much-needed urban version, a great introduction and full of important information on adapting permaculture to an urban environment."<strong>--Starhawk, permaculture designer and author of&nbsp;<em>The Empowerment Manual</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>The Permaculture City</em> is a triumph in bringing the wisdom of permaculture practices to city dwellers.

Rich in practical knowledge, Toby Hemenway is a trailblazer in demystifying the art of living sustainably within ecosystems: teaching how YOU can be a collaborative partner in a healthy urban biosphere. This book&#x2019;s impact will be increasingly significant as we inevitably march toward living in built environments. For urban planners, architects, green builders, and simply citizens who want to enjoy a higher quality of life, <em>The Permaculture City</em> is The Book to lead the way.&#x201d;<strong>--Paul Stamets, author of <em>Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World</em>&nbsp;</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Permaculture is applied ecology, and its practice is evolving as society becomes more urbanized. As Toby Hemenway puts it, &#x2018;We&#x2019;re not just gardening plants but people, neighborhoods, and even cultures.&#x2019; Whether you&#x2019;re new to permaculture or a seasoned &#x2018;permie,&#x2019; <em>The Permaculture City</em> is essential: it captures the explorative state of the art in readable, often delightful prose. And, like all good permaculture books, it is eminently helpful at solving a myriad of practical problems in the home and garden.&#x201d;<strong>--Richard Heinberg, Senior Fellow, Post Carbon Institute</strong></p><br><br><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Toby Hemenway combines the skill of a storyteller with the vigour of experience and insight. He shows us an urban landscape with gardens, food, energy systems, and architecture that can ensure genuine sustainability. Beyond these vital elements, he also creates a template for a new kind of city: a human scale collection of village communities where quality of life is valued above quantity of output. With the majority of the human race becoming city dwellers, this is vital information for a more collaborative, intelligent, and resilient urban landscape, one that will enable us to face serious challenges now, and in the future.&#x201d;<strong>--Maddy Harland, co-founder and editor of Permaculture magazine and Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts</strong></p><br><br><p>&nbsp;"Toby Hemenway is among the true visionaries who can turn vision into practical action. <em>The Permaculture City</em> is a landmark book that will be used for decades as a compass and field guide to regenerate our world and communities. Toby depicts the virtuous circle people are already creating across the country and world, from small acts an individual can take, to larger systemic changes that only communities and societies can make. This is the gospel of building resilience from the ground up, and Toby is a true hero of our age&#x2015;he shows us we&#x2019;re all invited to the party.&#x201d;--<strong>Kenny Ausubel, cofounder and CEO of Bioneers</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Half the world&#x2019;s people now live in cities, and as Toby Hemenway convincingly demonstrates, they can be at the very forefront of the revolution in how we live.

Nothing could compare to the exhilaration of a close race in a real blow&#x2014;the wind howling and spray flying as my Sunfish and I punched through the waves to the finish.&#x201d;</b><br><br>In the spring of 1992, Nat Philbrick was in his late thirties, living with his family on Nantucket, feeling stranded and longing for that thrill of victory he once felt after winning a national sailing championship in his youth. Was it a midlife crisis? It was certainly a watershed for the journalist-turned-stay-at-home dad, who impulsively decided to throw his hat into the ring, or water, again. <br><br>With the bemused approval of his wife and children, Philbrick used the off-season on the island as his solitary training ground, sailing his tiny Sunfish to its remotest corners, experiencing the haunting beauty of its tidal creeks, inlets, and wave-battered sandbars. On ponds, bays, rivers, and finally at the championship on a lake in the heartland of America, he sailed through storms and memories, racing for the prize, but finding something unexpected about himself instead.</p><p><b>Nathaniel Philbrick</b> is the author of <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i>, winner of the National Book Award; <i>Mayflower</i>, finalist for the Pulitzer Prize; <i>Bunker Hill</i>, winner of the New England Book Award; <i>Sea of Glory</i>; <i>The Last Stand</i>; <i>Why Read Moby Dick?</i>; <i>Valiant Ambition</i>; and <i>Away Off Shore</i>.<b>The Race</b><br><br> I should have known better. You can't just "get" a life.<br><br> Six years earlier Melissa and I had tried to do exactly that by moving to the island of Nantucket, twenty-four miles off the New England coast. We had grown tired of living and working around big cities; we wanted more time with our children and with each other; and besides, back then we had both hoped to sail again. Perhaps on Nantucket, once the mother ship of American whaling, we could create an environment for our children in which we were all, figuratively, if not literally, in the same boat.<br><br> But it didn't start out the way we had planned. Melissa soon found that life as an attorney on a real-estate obsessed island was as demanding as it had been in the city. For my part, being a housebound writer and parent on relatively tiny Nantucket was even more claustrophobic than it had been in the suburb we had previously called home. An island is a tough place to be landlocked.<br><br> But there was more to it than that. Something dark and disturbing would occasionally punch through the surface, reveal just a hint of its massive, lugubrious bulk, then vanish again, only to reappear at the strangest of times. I began to sense that something weird, huge, and scary was, well, out there. And then one February afternoon I saw it-a whale.<br><br> It had been back in the days when Ethan still fit comfortably on my shoulders. We were on one of our daily walks along the south shore of the island when the kids and I found ourselves on a bluff overlooking a winter beach and a crowd of people clustered around the black lifeless shape of a young humpback, less than twenty feet long. In her death spasms she'd vomited her stomach lining, and the placenta-like mess floated in the waves beside her. Two men with clipboards and waders measured the carcass and took notes. Children clambered over the whale's smooth, rubbery body, bouncing on her upturned belly as if she were a trampoline. That February afternoon, with my daughter beside me and my son perched on my shoulders, I first realized that it was time for a change. Like that youthful whale, I was stranded. At some point, I would have to return to the sea.<br><br> By the spring of 1992, I was working on a history of Nantucket that gave me a renewed appreciation for the island's maritime traditions. And even before I'd made that America's Cup-induced resolution to get back into serious racing, I found myself making another sailing-related commitment: I had agreed to run the sailing program at the Nantucket Yacht Club. I'd always assumed my days as a sailing instructor were behind me. But Jennie and Ethan were growing up, and as a seasonal position, the job dovetailed nicely with my life as a writer.<br><br> That summer Melissa and the kids were given the opportunity to race a borrowed Beetle Cat (known as a Rainbow on Nantucket), the same kind of boat in which Melissa and I had had our first date. Although I was happy for them, it was also frustrating. As they won an impressive number of blue first-place flags, my yacht club duties required that I remain rooted to an NYC support boat. I felt left out of my children's introduction to the sport that had been so important to my own coming of age. And what about me?<br><br> As the summer passed, the conversation around the dinner table was becoming unendurable.<br><br> Jennie: "How many flags have we won so far?"<br><br> Ethan: "Four."<br><br> Jennie: "But they're all blue."<br><br> Ethan: "I know. I'd like a red one."<br><br> Jennie: "Or how about a yellow one?"<br><br> Ethan: "Mommy, can we come in third next weekend, please?"<br><br> It was clearly time for someone to put my wife and especially my children in their place. By the end of July, I'd come up with Plan Gordon.<br><br> Gordon was new to the sport. A marathon runner and bike racer, he had purchased a Beetle Cat only the year before. Although he was obviously in tip-top shape, he lacked the experience to race competitively and was becoming frustrated. He needed some tactical advice and instruction. What he needed, I decided, was me. One Saturday morning I happened to run into Gordon on the yacht club lawn. It was soon agreed that I would crew for him in the first race after I had assisted my staff in setting up the race course.<br><br> Part of the beauty of Plan Gordon was the element of surprise. Melissa and the kids would have no idea what they were up against until the last possible moment. And, as luck would have it, they were over on the other side of the harbor when I jumped from the yacht club's mark boat into Gordon's Beetle Cat.<br><br> With only a few minutes before the start, I fiddled with the various adjustments to the sail in an attempt to optimize its shape. As I stared up at the flapping panels of Dacron cloth and tugged on some lines, Gordon questioned me about what I was doing. Although I tried to answer as best I could, I found myself irresistibly looking out for the competition: a white Beetle Cat with a green sail and three members of my family on board.<br><br> An air horn sounded, indicating that we had three minutes before the start. With a familiar rush of adrenaline, I reached involuntarily for the tiller, but there was Gordon-and he needed some pointers. I told Gordon to sail over toward the committee boat. That's where Melissa and the kids were hanging out, their sail luffing lazily as Ethan dangled his hand in the blue, sun-glinting water. These guys wouldn't know what hit them.<br><br> On my cue Gordon tacked, turning us so that we crossed into the wind and ended up beside Melissa, our sail also luffing. The rest of the fleet of about five other boats was behind us, which was good-as long as we didn't cross the line too early.<br><br> "Hey, Daddy!" Jennie shouted. "What are you doing out here?"<br><br> I chose to ignore her. I did notice, however, that her mother was looking straight at me. Melissa knew exactly what I was up to.<br><br> We were down to the last thirty seconds, the most critical time, with that green-sailed Beetle beside us. Ethan, the collar of his yellow lifejacket pressed up against his chin, looked under the boat's sail.<br><br> "Hi, Daddy!" he called out.<br><br> Once again, I chose to ignore him.<br><br> "Daddy!"<br><br> "What?" I finally said.<br><br> "How ya doin'?"<br><br> "I'm doing-"<br><br> The starting horn blew, and in a blink of an eye Melissa and company were off. Okay, so I was a little late pulling in the sail, and maybe that's why they were able to surge ahead of us, but if Ethan had just not distracted me . . .<br><br> Since sails flutter uselessly like flags when pointed directly into the wind, a sailboat must approach the first "upwind" mark indirectly, tacking back and forth across the course. And where a Nantucket whaleman thought in terms of weather systems and continental currents as he navigated the oceans of the world, a modern small boat racer approaches each momentary change in the wind as if it were a storm front, each point of land as if it were Cape Horn. This hypersensitivity to the elements means that the first leg of a typical race becomes a panicky, zigzag quest for the fastest path to the windward mark.<br><br> And as it so happened, halfway up the first leg we caught a nice wind shift on the right-hand side of the course and were suddenly back in contention. Gordon was doing an excellent job of steering the boat, and yet I found it impossible not to be a micromanager, offering a continual stream of advice: "Toward the sail a little bit . . . now away from the sail . . . that's it!"<br><br> The first mark of the race was a torpedo-shaped buoy anchored in the harbor channel, not far from the long barrier beach, known as Coatue, that forms the outer edge of Nantucket Harbor. Since the entire, seven-mile length of the harbor empties and fills around the end of this giant sand spit, the current there is usually quite fierce, as much as three to four knots. But all concern for the current was temporarily suspended when I realized that we were battling for first with Melissa and the kids.<br><br> The conservative thing for us to do would have been to duck behind Melissa and then tack, essentially following her to the mark. But I was not about to yield. It was all or nothing. I told Gordon that with one perfectly executed tack we could knife in between Melissa and the mark. He looked underneath the sail to see what lay ahead. What he saw obviously worried him. "Are you sure?" he asked.<br><br> But by then it was too late. "Tack!" I shouted. As Gordon jammed the tiller over, I realized that I had made a terrible mistake. The tide was rushing in much faster than I had realized. Try as I might to get us moving forward instead of&nbsp; sideways in the current, we were soon wrapped around the buoy.<br><br> There is nothing worse than being pinned against a mark in a strong tide. It's humiliating, particularly when your wife and children sail past singing "Found a Peanut."<br><br> There are no referees in sailing; it's up to the competitors to discipline themselves. If you commit a foul, by hitting a mark or another boat or by getting in someone else's way, you can exonerate yourself by sailing one or two complete circles (depending on the seriousness of the transgression) as a penalty. It is not a fun maneuver, and after disentangling ourselves from the mark and doing our penance, I apologized to Gordon. To his credit, he seemed completely unflustered by the incident. Who cared if we were now in third? We were still in the hunt, with plenty of race left to sail.<br><br> The wind was now from behind, putting us on a broad reach to the next mark. It turned out that Gordon's boat was fast on this point of sail, and we were able to round the next mark in second. Melissa and the kids were still quite a way out ahead.<br><br> Then it happened. Suddenly, and for no apparent reason, that green-sailed Beetle turned around and headed right for us. I could see Jennie up on the bow, her long blond hair flowing back in the breeze as she pointed at something in the water while Ethan shouted excitedly from the cockpit. Then, just before we came abreast of them, Melissa spun the boat around, the sail swooping across dramatically as Jennie plunged her hand into the water. The kids began to cheer. What was going on?<br><br> Waving a sodden baseball cap in the air, Jennie explained: "I dropped it overboard and Mommy went back to get it."<br><br> Melissa smiled and shrugged. I didn't know what Gordon was thinking, but this was more than I could stand. This was a race. To turn back for a stupid hat was unthinkable, particularly when you were in first place. The implication was clear: I can do almost anything and still win.<br><br> The gloves were off.<br><br> We rounded the last mark with Melissa less than a boat length ahead of us. With one, relatively short upwind leg before the finish, it was time to make things happen. So we tacked in an attempt to find a shift of wind that would help us. But Melissa wasn't about to let us get away with it, tacking almost immediately to position her sail between ours and the wind. So we tacked again-as did, of course, Melissa. It was, in the parlance of the America's Cup commentators on ESPN, a tacking duel to the death.<br><br> Beetle Cats are too heavy to tolerate too much tacking, but we put our boats through their paces. Luckily, the boat in third was unable to take advantage of our infighting, and we were still neck and neck going into the finish. On board our boat, the tension was palpable: my hands trembled with excitement; Gordon's eyes blazed with competitive fire.<br><br> It was a replay of the first leg. Melissa was approaching the finish line on one tack; we were on the other. The plan, once again, was to suddenly tack just ahead of her, shoot up into the wind, and grab the victory. If it was close, I figured my boys on the committee boat would give us the nod, knowing that their jobs depended on it. I warned Gordon of the impending maneuver, and both of us were glancing toward that green-sailed menace when Gordon laughed. He laughed!<br><br> "Will you look at that!" he cried.<br><br> "What?" I shouted. "What?"<br><br> "Look at your son!"<br><br> I squinted through my salt-spattered sunglasses. Ethan was leaning against the combing of the cockpit, his head wobbling drunkenly with each bob of the boat. My God, the kid was asleep! Asleep? At a time like this? Didn't he know he was in the midst of a tacking duel to the death?!<br><br> That, I must admit, took the stuffing right out of us. Slam-dunking a mother and her sleeping babe is a difficult thing to do, even if you are the husband and father. By the time Gordon and I pulled ourselves together, it was too late. The moment to pounce had passed, and when we did eventually tack, Melissa walked right over us and took the gun. The worst part was that she and Jennie didn't cheer; otherwise they might have disturbed Ethan.<br><br> Up a Creek<br><br> Before I knew it, Labor Day had come and gone and the kids were back in school. Time for me to leave the waterfront behind and become a writer again.<br><br> But after two weeks researching old documents, I was thinking about sailing again. The Gordon debacle still stung, but I knew that there had to be more appropriate ways to work out a decade and a half's worth of stifled sailing frustrations than taking on my wife and kids in a Beetle Cat. I knew that relief could only come in a Sunfish.<br><br> By the end of September I'd learned that the 1993 Sunfish North Americans were to be sailed on a man-made lake in Springfield, Illinois, in July. Illinois? In July? Wasn't it kind of ridiculous, venturing to the Land of Lincoln from the Island of Ahab?<br><br> For me the site had one undeniable advantage, however. Lake Springfield was notorious for its light winds. Since I was no longer in the physical condition I'd been in fifteen years before, the lighter the wind, the better. But there was another consideration. By traveling to Lake Springfield I would be, in a sense, returning home.</p><h2>For the Love of Mike: A Molly Murphy Mystery (Molly Murphy Mysteries, 3)</h2><p><p><b>From the author of <i>In Farleigh Field..</i>.</b></p><p>Molly Murphy is starting to think the cards are stacked against her.

The Introduction sets these works in historical context, stretching from the conclusion of the Peloponnesian War through Alexander's conquest of Asia, and provides an assessment of Alexander's historical importance as well as a survey of the central controversies surrounding his personality, aims and intentions. This edition includes a timeline, maps, a bibliography, a glossary, and an index.</p></p><p><p>James Romm is the James H. Ottoway, Jr. Associate Professor of Classics at Bard College.

Romm's Introduction is fresh, mature, and insightful--one of the best brief synopses of Alexander's life and impact this reviewer has read in recent years. . . . Romm's carefully selected and well-translated passages from Arrian provide a vivid and cohesive narrative of the highlights of Alexander's career. Wherever there is a major discrepancy among our ancient sources, or wherever an alternate version seems to enrich Arrian's account, Romm relegates the variant source to his notes, thereby providing the enhancement without disrupting the main narrative. He has thus preserved the flow of Arrian's narrative, while also providing a commentary that alerts the reader to some of the pitfalls that mark any attempt to understand the course of Alexander's achievements. I highly recommend this work as a pedagogical component in the teaching of basic courses on Alexander. And even some battle-hardened advanced students, scholars of the Macedonian monarchy, and history buffs would benefit by the insights of Romm's introductory essay and the notes accompanying Arrian's text. --Eugene N.

No one who meets him in person can remember him 5 minutes later. It makes it easy to have one-night stands, but hard to have a meaningful relationship, and without true love he can never regain his soul. When he finally meets Cassandra, the one woman who can remember him, she turns out to be the princess of the cursed race he's sworn to hunt-and forbidden to him. The two of them must face ancient curses, prophecies, and the direct meddling of the Greek gods to find true happiness at last.</p></p><p><p>Dear Reader,</p><p>What do you get when you have one immortal Viking warrior no one can remember five minutes after he leaves their presence, a princess on the run for her life, and one seriously annoyed demigod?

What did they eat, and what affected their health? How did the family function? To answer these and similar questions, Borowski describes the natural setting and the people who occupied the land as well as the rural and urban economic activities in which ancient Israelites engaged, especially as they related to the family and social-political structure. The book addresses cultural, social, and religious activities as well as art, music, and the place of writing in Israelite society.

Just before his release from service in the Israeli army, Ora&#x2019;s son Ofer is sent back to the front for a major offensive. In a fit of preemptive grief and magical thinking, so that no bad news can reach her, Ora sets out on an epic hike in the Galilee. She is joined by an unlikely companion&#x2014;Avram, a former friend and lover with a troubled past&#x2014;and as they sleep out in the hills, Ora begins to conjure her son. Ofer&#x2019;s story, as told by Ora, becomes a surprising balm both for her and for Avram&#x2014;and a mother&#x2019;s haunting meditation on war and family.<br><br>ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: <i>The Christian Science Monitor, The Economist, The New Republic, The New Yorker, The Washington Post, </i>and <i>The Pittsburgh Post Gazette</i><br>&nbsp;<br>A <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>NOTABLE BOOK</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, September 2010</strong>: <em>To the End of the Land</em> is a book of mourning for those not dead, a mother's lament for life during a wartime that has no end in sight. At the same time, it's joyously and almost painfully alive, full to the point of rupture with the emotions and the endless quotidian details of a few deeply imagined lives. Ora, the Israeli mother in Grossman's story, is surrounded by men: Ilan and Avram, friends and lovers who form with her a love triangle whose intimacies and alliances fit no familiar shape, and their sons Adam and Ofer, one for each father, from whom Ora feels her separation like a wound. When Ofer, freshly released from his army service, volunteers for an action in the West Bank instead of going on a planned hike with his mother in the north of Israel, she goes instead with Avram, who fathered Ofer but has never met him and has lived in near-seclusion since being tortured as a prisoner in the Yom Kippur war three decades before. As they walk and carefully reveal themselves to each other again, Grossman builds an overwhelming portrait of, as one character says, the "thousands of moments and hours and days" that make "one person in the world," and of the power of war to destroy such a person, even--or especially--when they survive its cruel demands. <em>--Tom Nissley</em><p>David Grossman&nbsp;was born in Jerusalem.

Blizzard presents comparisons between the words of Jesus and the words of rabbis prior to, contemporary with, and following Jesus, recorded for us in the <em>Mishnah</em>, <em>Order Nezikin</em>, Tractate <em>Avot</em>, or the <em>Chapters of the Fathers</em> (<em>Pirkei Avot</em>).</p> <p>Probably anyone who has ever focused on the teachings of Jesus in any depth is aware that he was a product of the religious milieu that emerged in the 1st century of this present era. The four gospels preserve for us the largest and the best corpus of material relating to the ideas and methods of teaching of the rabbis of that period. As we compare the words of Jesus with the other rabbis of his day, we can begin to understand where some of the ideas originated, the way they were thinking, and the themes upon which they were teaching.</p> <p>In the teachings of Jesus, there is one underlying and overriding theme, a theme on which Jesus consistently dwells, a theme that serves as the foundation upon which biblical faith is built. That foundational theme is summed up in the Hebrew word <em>tzedakah</em>, the word frequently translated into English as righteousness. <em>Tzedakah</em> is the outstanding, overriding, and yet simple, theme of Jesus.</p> <p>Biblical faith is not so much man always directing his attention upward toward God but, rather, through acts of <em>tzedakah</em>, reaching out to others, meeting them at the point of their need and assisting in making them whole. Principles of biblical faith are not directed upward. It is not something one does for God. It is directed outward toward one's fellow man, but in so doing, at one and the same time, one performs the will of the Father.</p> <p>Throughout <em>Mishnah and the Words of Jesus</em>, Dr. Blizzard points out how the Sages echo one another and how it all harmonizes completely with the words of Jesus.

Your guides -- Jack Prelutsky, poet laureate of the elementary school set, and two-time Caldecott Honor artist Peter Sis -- invite you to join them on an adventure you will never forget!</p></p><p>Poet Jack Prelutsky again pairs up with two-time Caldecott Honor artist Peter S�s to create Scranimal Island, a fantastical, off-the-map place inhabited by unusual animals from Hippopotamushrooms to Potatoads to a pride of Broccolions. A boy and girl on a scooter, equipped with essentials from umbrella to inner tube, fly from habitat to habitat over S�s's dreamy, mountainous landscapes � la <i>Tibet: Through the Red Box</i>. They make their way through the clutch of Spinachickens, past the Camelberta Peaches to the "Sweet Porcupineapple, / Unflappable chap, / You happily amble / All over the map." Prelutsky's biological inventions are as clever as they are silly, and it's wonderful that kids are allowed to figure out the hybrid themselves in Rhinocerose, Cardinalbacore, etc. Prelutsky's glee is contagious, and kids will get a kick out of the wordplay in poems like "Oh Sleek Bananaconda": "You slither on your belly, / And you slither on your chin. / You're only unappealing / As you shed your slinky skin." Pronunciation guides for each creature garnish each page, in case you can't pronounce Toucanemones right off the bat, and an iconic guide to the island's animals adorns the table of contents page. Gorgeous endpapers reveal S�s's map of Scranimal Island and its curious denizens. It's impossible to pick a favorite, between the unbelievably cute Pandaffodil and the detested Radishark.

Seraphim found out that the early Western Father, Blessed Augustine of Hippo, was being attacked in contemporary Eastern Orthodox circles, then he--himself a Western convert to Orthodoxy--rose in his defense. This book is the outcome. Fr. Seraphim said he wrote it in the hope that it would help remove Augustine as a scapegoat for today's academic theologians, and thus "help free us all to see his and our own weaknesses in a little closer light--for his weaknesses, to a surprising degree, are indeed close to our own." <p>After discussing Blessed Augustine's strengths and weaknesses, Fr. Seraphim examines the opinions of other Holy Fathers concerning him. "His main benefit to us today," he writes, "is probably precisely as a <i>Father of Orthodox piety</i>something with which he was filled to overflowing. Here he is one with the simple Orthodox faithful, as well as with all the Holy Fathers of East and West who, whatever their various failings and differences in theoretical points of doctrine, had a single deeply Christian heart and soul. It is this that makes him unquestionably an <i>Orthodox</i> Father." </p><p>This new edition of <i>The Place of Blessed Augustine in the Orthodox Church</i> contains letters written by Fr. Seraphim concerning Augustine, passages from Augustine's Confessions which Fr. Seraphim found especially moving, and an Orthodox service to Blessed Augustine, commissioned by St. John Maximovitch.</p></p><p>Fr. Seraphim Rose (1934-1982) was an Orthodox monk in the ancient tradition that dedicated his life to reawakening modern Western man to forgotten spiritual truths. From his remote cabin in the mountains of northern California, he produced writings, which have been circulated throughout the world in millions of copies. Today he is Russia's best-loved spiritual writer. His books <i>Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future</i> and <i>The Soul After Death</i> have changed countless lives with their uncompromising and sobering truth.Narrow is the mansion of my soul; enlarge Thou it, that Thou mayest enter in...for without Thee what am I to myself except a guide to my own downfall? --Blessed Augustine of Hippo</p><h2>Gift Horse: A Lakota Story</h2><p>Relates the story of a Lakota youth whose father gives him a horse in preparation for his making the transition from boyhood into manhood and becoming a Lakota Warrior.</p><p>An action-packed coming-of-age story, Gift Horse is a wonderfully evocative introduction to 19th-century Native American life on the Great Plains.

Scattered wildflowers nestled within the long grass, and the colors of the horizon were almost whimsical in their beauty.<br><br>Scarlet Barlow kept her distance, though the animal didn't seem to be the least bit afraid of her. The elk in the area were accustomed to people who came to hike the mountainous country, the crests and valleys and little plateau where the onetime Conway Ranch was now a bed-and-breakfast, complete with a gift shop and museum. No one disturbed the elk that came here to graze the lush meadows, and the elk apparently knew that. The B and B was a mere stone's throw from the eastern entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park, so those who came to admire the animal life there meant it no harm.<br><br>The big bull elk seemed to be aware that he was posing like a model; it was almost as if he was happy to offer her the photo op.<br><br>She snapped several pictures, paused and glanced at them on the screen, then smiled, pleased with what she had captured.<br><br>"Thank you, sir," she said to him, then turned away and looked out over the natural splendor of the Rockies and the town of Estes Park, nestled among them.<br><br>People came here for many reasons.<br><br>One of the biggies was The Stanley Hotel. Stephen King had been staying there when he'd been inspired to write <em>The Shining.</em> The hotel offered both ghost and historical tours, and Scarlet loved it. She liked to imagine what the author had thought and to hear the staff talk about how the events in the book related to what had really happened there.<br><br>The Conway Ranch, where she'd been working as a researcher and curator for the past two months, had a history just as unique and intriguing, even if not as well-known. She loved knowing that her contributions to the small on-site museum were helping it to become more and more of an attraction on its own. The ranch had been founded in the 1860s, just a few years after Joel Estes had established the town and a few months after Welsh explorer Griffith Evans had opened a dude ranch in the area. Ranching was no easy matter in this mountainous country seventy-five hundred feet above sea level. And as far as the Con-way Ranch went, "ranching" had long meant guided trail rides for the tourists.<br><br>Scarlet smiled. She couldn't get over the awe she always felt as she looked at the towering snowcapped peaks of the Rockies.<br><br>She'd been told nothing compared to the Canadian Rockies, but she couldn't imagine that any scenery could be more beautiful than this.<br><br>Even the town felt special to her, with its unique shops and restaurants, everything nestled in a natural paradise of mountain peaks and forests cut through by brooks that were bubbling and bright in the sunlight, cool and mysterious by night. Hikers, horseback riders and tubers and rafters, who took their chances with the rapids, came year-round to enjoy the scenery.<br><br>This place was as different from her native South Florida as it could get, but both were natural playgrounds, and this was a perfect place to be. At least for now.<br><br>Her apartment was on the top floor of what had once been a storage barn for feed and ranching equipment. Now it housed the museum on the ground floor and her two-bedroom apartment on the second. The museum had actually come about accidentally. The original builder had started out organizing his own Civil War and Native American memorabilia, then added more pieces as he acquired them. Over the years various people had taken a stab at cataloging everything, but finally the current owner had decided it was time for a professional to come in and make sense of it all.<br><br>And that was where Scarlet had entered the picture.<br><br>She'd been a bookworm all her life, with a particular interest in history. At college she'd majored in history and minored in archaeology, going on to get master's degrees in both. What she loved most wasn't the bare bones of dates and places but the stories that went along with events, stories about the people who'd actually lived at the time and whose experiences provided a unique perspective.<br><br>After college she had worked in New York for several years before she had been invited to come home to South Florida to work a new dig in the field she considered her specialty, eighteenth and nineteenth century America, at the mouth of the Miami River. She had followed both the lure of the job and her heart, taking the position not only for itself, but also to be closer to the man she'd loved, FBI agent Diego McCullough. And now, thanks to the current owner of the ranch, Ben Kendall, she was here in Colorado.<br><br>Ben, a descendant of the original owner, Nathan Kendall, and his wife, Trisha, had purchased the place five years ago. For them, restoring the Conway Ranch was a labor of love. They'd refurbished it with the money he'd made as a New York stockbroker, having given up the city life to return to his family roots.<br><br>A history buff from way back, he had tracked down Scarlet in New York City after discovering that she, too, had a family connection to the ranch and to him, and they'd stayed in touch when she went back to Florida, where she'd eventually married Diego. And he'd been right there with a job offer after the divorce, when she'd wanted and needed to get away.<br><br>"Scarlet! Afternoon!" Ben called out to her now from the wide porch of the main house, breaking into her thoughts.<br><br>Given the time, she realized he must have just returned from leading the afternoon trail ride, just as he did six days a week. Angus Fillmore&#x2014;the quintessential cowboy, with his long white hair and beard, solid shoulders and strong arms&#x2014;was still leading horses into the stables. One of the guests, Terry Ballantree, thirtyish and another descendant of Nathan Kendall, was talking animatedly to Angus, who was nodding politely but didn't seem to be saying much. Gwen and Charles Barton, newlyweds from Mississippi, were waiting for their chance to say something to Angus, but Terry seemed to be nothing if not long-winded.<br><br>"Scarlet, I'm glad to run into you," Ben told her, just as the head housekeeper, Linda Reagan, tall, slim and very pretty, stepped out on the porch behind him.<br><br>"Don't forget to wipe your boots off before you come inside," Linda said, then waved to Scarlet.<br><br>"I will, I will!" Ben promised, then joined Scarlet on the wide front lawn.<br><br>She smiled, wondering how he had ever been a stockbroker. He was fifty-five and blessed with a full head of snow-white hair that he liked to keep long. He always had a smile on his face now, which he hadn't had when she'd first met him. The stress of working on Wall Street had kept him looking harried and worn, but now he was a happy man. He'd told her once that he was certain he'd really been made for the great outdoors.<br><br>"You're welcome on the ride anytime," he told her. "I know you love the horses."<br><br>"Believe it or not, Ben, I grew up around horses."<br><br>"South Florida? That's beach country."<br><br>"There are lots of horses all over the state," she said. "I grew up in Davie. We had horses there, and my folks still do."<br><br>"Well, I'll be damned," he said. "So how's it going? Are you liking the job?"<br><br>"I love it here," she assured him. "Your collection is amazing. Colts from just about every era from the 1850s onward, Spencer repeating rifles, Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers, Winchesters, you name it. Worth a fortune, if you wanted to sell."<br><br>He shook his head. "My selling days are over. I'm looking forward to spending every day here, sharing all this with our guests, for the rest of my life."<br><br>"You're a happy man," she said.<br><br>He grinned. "Best wife in the world and this little piece of heaven. How can I not be happy? Looks like you appreciate the place, too." He nodded toward her camera.<br><br>"I just got a terrific picture of an elk. Big guy with a huge set of antlers."<br><br>"Can't bring yourself to say 'big rack,' huh?" he teased.<br><br>She laughed. "Honestly, it never occurred to me. One thing we don't have in Florida are elk. Especially not elk that like to pose for you."<br><br>"Let me see," Ben said.<br><br>She produced her camera and hit the little button to show her stored photos.<br><br>Ben took the camera from her with a grin on his face, but his grin froze as he stared at the screen and then at her. "Where the hell were you? What is this?" he demanded, handing the camera back to her.<br><br>Startled, Scarlet took the camera and stared at the screen. There was no bull elk with majestic antlers. It was the same spot, but the picture was of a man. A man hanging from a branch of a mighty oak, blood dripping from his body to the ground.<br><br>She stared at it, stunned.<br><br>"I&#x2014;I didn't take this!" she said.<br><br>She hit the button to switch to the next picture. That one showed two people, the same man and a woman, on the ground, tangled together in a pool of blood.<br><br>She f licked backward and saw a picture of the woman while she was still alive, though just barely. A large red stain covered her midriff, her arms were thrown back and her mouth was open in an O of agony and shock. It looked as if a bullet had just ripped through her body.<br><br>Dead people. Her pictures were of dead people.<br><br>She flicked back to the shot of the couple. It was hard to tell exactly which limbs belonged to which person as they embraced in a pool of blood.<br><br>"Honestly, Scarlet, what the hell?"<br><br>"I&#x2014;I don't know," she said. "I didn't take these. I never saw any of this. I&#x2014;I was right over there," she said, pointing.<br><br>He looked at her for a moment as if she was severely disturbed. Scarlet looked back at the camera, flicking through the many shots she had taken in search of the elk.<br><br>It wasn't there anywhere.<br><br>Just the man and the woman...<br><br>Perhaps her stunned expression had an effect on Ben, who asked, "Can a camera be hacked?"<br><br>"I don't think so," she said. "But I just don't get it. I didn't see anything like that, and I never would have taken pictures of it if I had." She shook her head and handed the camera back to Ben, as if she couldn't bear to touch it.<br><br>Ben studied the camera and scrolled through the shots, then stared at her, frowning. "What did you do that for?"<br><br>"Do what?"<br><br>"Erase them all."<br><br>"I didn't erase anything!"<br><br>"Well, they're gone. I admit your elk is fantastic, but why on earth would you fake pictures of corpses on my property?" Ben said.<br><br>She stared at him, angry now, and totally confused. How could those vile shots have disappeared and the elk have reappeared in their place? "Really, Ben? You think I could do something like that? Because I didn't take those pictures, and I didn't erase them, either. I don't know how they got there, but I had nothing to do with it."<br><br>"I'm sorry, Scarlet. But they <em>were</em> there, and it was a real shock to see them."<br><br>He stared at her, puzzled, but she thought he believed her.<br><br>"We should just take your camera in to Marty Decker. He runs a great camera shop in town. I'm sure he can figure out what's going on. You know, even if it's just a camera, I think anything and everything can be hacked these days. I wouldn't even have a computer if we didn't need the damned thing for the business. Leave it with me. I'll get it to him, and I'll make sure he saves your pictures of the elk. They're really beautiful."<br><br>"Thanks, Ben," she told him. "I use computers and cameras all the time while I'm working, but I've never seen anything like this."<br><br>Ben shrugged, then asked, "You going to join us for dinner?"<br><br>She was still offended that he could even think she would do something like that, but on the other hand, she couldn't really blame him. She forced a smile. "No, I've got some paperwork to finish, but thank you for the invitation. You're sure you don't mind taking the camera to your friend?"<br><br>"Not at all."<br><br>"Okay, thanks." She gave him a little wave and walked away. Terry Ballantree and the Bartons crossed her path, so she paused to say hello, even though she longed to get away and try to sort out what had happened.<br><br>"Scarlet, thanks so much for the tour yesterday," Terry said. "Any way I can get another look before dinner? I'd love another look at some of those old photos."<br><br>"We loved it, too," Gwen said.<br><br>"I'm glad you enjoyed yourselves," Scarlet said. "Ben is kind of strict about the museum. It's only open Thursday to Sunday, and this is Monday, but if you're all here for a few more days, I'll ask him if I can take you back through for a private tour tomorrow or Wednesday."<br><br>"Thanks," Terry said.<br><br>"That would be great," Gwen said. She and Charles were both in their twenties, and they almost looked like children playing at marriage, but Scarlet had found them both to be open and friendly. Charles had been a football player at Ole Miss, and Gwen had been a cheerleader. Now he had just started his own law practice. Gwen was blonde and blue-eyed, a perfect contrast to his tall, dark and handsome.<br><br>Terry was a nice guy, too, though his neverending enthusiasm was a bit exhausting. He was good-looking, with sandy-brown hair and large hazel eyes, a generous mouth and a perfect nose. While he was only medium height, he was in good shape.<br><br>But with her nerves completely frayed right now, she just wasn't up to dealing with any of them.<br><br>"I'll talk to Ben and let you know," Scarlet said, then quickly made her escape. "See you all later," she called over her shoulder.<br><br>The old storage barn had been given windows sometime at the end of the Victorian era, and though plain shades were drawn over the museum windows, those upstairs boasted pretty drapes.<br><br>Scarlet unlocked the door and stepped inside. The security lights, added to the last of the daylight seeping in, created an eerie glow, but it didn't bother her in the least. She was in love with the place. Many of the displays were the originals, over a hundred years old, as were the placards they held, written in cursive by a gentle hand almost a hundred and fifty years ago.<br><br>There were life-size figures on pedestals arranged throughout the room, ranging from Ute chiefs in full battle regalia to Yankee and Rebel soldiers, fur trappers, gunslingers and frontier women, along with excellent re-creations of real people like Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir. There were twenty-two of them altogether, the oldest nearly as old as the ranch itself. Her favorite was a Ute woman holding a child and looking skyward. There was something so beautiful in her expression that Scarlet was certain she had been modeled from life by an artist who adored her.</p><h2>Tappan&#39;s Handbook of Massage Therapy: Blending Art with Science</h2><p><p> <em>For introduction to massage therapy or massage techniques/modalities courses</em> </p> <p> <strong>Prepare massage therapists for success with a next-generation learning tool </strong> <br>Successful massage therapists excel at blending the art and science of the profession. <em> <strong>Tappan's Handbook of Massage Therapy: Blending Art and Science</strong> </em> is a learning tool for a new generation, but it results from years of experience, wisdom, and research on the part of the author and contributing therapists.

This latest edition of <em>Tappan&#x2019;s Handbook</em> combines all three of its predecessors for the most comprehensive and up-to-date presentation of the theory and practice of massage therapy available today. <em>Tappan&#x2019;s Handbook of Massage Therapy: Blending Art and Science, </em>sixth edition, remains true to Frances Tappan&#x2019;s vision of healing massage as holistic manual therapy that contributes to the well-being of humanity in so many ways.</p> <p>In her leisure time, Dr. Benjamin enjoys reading historical fiction and nonfiction, gardening, tai chi and qi gong, and table tennis. Her outdoor pursuits include hiking, canoeing, and birding. She currently resides in Chicago, Illinois.</p></p><h2>Politics (Focus Philosophical Library)</h2><p><p>The Focus Philosophical Library's edition of Aristotle's <i>Politics </i>is a lucid and useful translation for the student of undergraduate philosophy, as well as for the general reader interested in the major works of western civilization.

Built over an unquiet grave, the House of the Seven Gables carries a dying man's curse that blights the lives of its residents for over two centuries. Now Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon, an iron-hearted hypocrite and intellectual heir to the mansion's unscrupulous founder, is attempting to railroad a pair of his elderly relatives out of the house. Only two young people stand in his way &#x2014; a visiting country cousin and an enigmatic boarder skilled in mesmerism.<br>Hawthorne envisioned this family drama of evil, revenge, and resolution as a microcosm of Salem's own history as in idealistic society corrupted by greed and pride. His enduring view of the darkness at the heart of the national soul has made <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i> a landmark of American literature.</p></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

In this new edition, author Harry Wolcott continues to focus on the "writing side" of qualitative research, while incorporating new features such as guidelines on how and where to use theory.<br> <br> This text is ideal as a supplementary text in any upper-level undergraduate or graduate seminar on the research process.</p><p><strong>Harry F. Wolcott&nbsp;</strong>(Ph.D. Stanford) taught at the University of Oregon, serving on both the faculties of education and anthropology. He authored several ethnographic texts that included his experiences among the Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia and with the African Beer Gardens of Bulawayo, Rhodesia, as well on ethnographic method and on writing itself, with a focus on qualitative research. His publications included: Transforming Qualitative Data (SAGE 1994); Art of Fieldwork (2nd ed., Altamira Press 2005); Ethnography: A Way of Seeing (2nd ed., Altamira Press 2008); Writing Up Qualitative Research (3rd ed., SAGE 2009); Sneaky Kid and Its Aftermath: Ethics and Intimacy in Fieldwork (Altamira 2002), and Ethnography Lessons: A Primer (Left Coast Press, 2010)."Throughout, the guidance remains very practical, keeping clearly in sight the goal of actually getting the writing task done. The style is friendly, chatty and humorous, resulting in a guidebook that is accessible and a pleasure to read. I would highly recommend this book to anyone whose work involves writing up qualitative research, not only if you encounter particular struggles, but also if you just appreciate some words of reassurance or encouragement from time to time." -- Annie Irvine Published On: 2010-02-22<br><br><p>"Wolcott&#x2019;s advice is highly individual, and much of it involves strategies for finding the techniques for writing and editing that best fit you as a writer. Wolcott explains his points in a friendly and accessible manner, which makes the book feel like a lively conversation with a colleague rather than an academic treatise on writing. <strong>Writing Up Qualitative Research </strong>is a valuable resource for academic writers at any stage of their careers. Graduate students will find the discussion of breaking out of the prescribed formulas of the dissertation genre very helpful. New academics will enjoy the advice for keeping writing relevant to the audience, as well as the chapters on negotiating the publication process. Even seasoned academic writers will not go away from Wolcott&#x2019;s book empty-handed, because it contains advice for guiding new writers and graduate students. Writing Up Qualitative Research is an enjoyable, refreshing, and useful monograph, and I know I will be using it for advice and inspiration for years to come."</p> -- Nicole St. Germaine-McDaniel Published On: 2010-09-29<br><br>"Throughout, the guidance remains very practical, keeping clearly in sight the goal of actually getting the writing task done...I would highly recommend this book to anyone whose work involves writing up qualitative research, not only if you encounter particular struggles, but also if you just appreciate some words of encouragement from time to time." -- Annie Irvine, <i>SRA</i> Published On: 2010-02-01<br><br>"<strong>Writing up Qualitative Research</strong>&nbsp;has CHIME&#x2015;compassion, humor, intelligence, mindfulness of humanity, and empirical evidence.

Drawing from a remarkable array of ancient and modern sources, Carlin Barton offers the most complex understanding to date of the emotional and spiritual life of the ancient Romans. Her provocative and original inquiry focuses on the sentiments of honor that shaped the Romans' sense of themselves and their society. Speaking directly to the concerns and curiosities of the contemporary reader, Barton brings Roman society to life, elucidating the complex relation between the inner life of its citizens and its social fabric.<br><br>Though thoroughly grounded in the ancient writings&#x2015;especially the work of Seneca, Cicero, and Livy&#x2015;this book also draws from contemporary theories of the self and social theory to deepen our understanding of ancient Rome. Barton explores the relation between inner desires and social behavior through an evocative analysis of the operation, in Roman society, of contests and ordeals, acts of supplication and confession, and the sense of shame. As she fleshes out Roman physical and psychological life, she particularly sheds new light on the consequential transition from republic to empire as a watershed of Roman social relations.<br><br>Barton's ability to build productively on both old and new scholarship on Roman history, society, and culture and her imaginative use of a wide range of work in such fields as anthropology, sociology, psychology, modern history, and popular culture will make this book appealing for readers interested in many subjects. This beautifully written work not only generates insight into Roman history, but also uses that insight to bring us to a new understanding of ourselves, our modern codes of honor, and why it is that we think and act the way we do.</p><p><b>Carlin A. Barton </b>is Professor of History at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and author of <i>The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans </i>(1993).&#34;A bold book. This book is written with passion. Like her earlier &#34;Sorrows of the Ancient Romans, it is also likely to arouse passionate responses, positive and negative, among her professional colleagues.

Although he is by all accounts happily married, many women carry a torch for him. Grace is no exception, so when Gregorian picks her out of a group of clerks to assist him in researching the infamous Hightower case, she considers herself lucky-maybe even blessed, when their first night on the job turns romantic. But her newfound happiness is shattered when the morning news announces that Gregorian has been found shot, apparently a suicide. Grace, knowing that it has to be murder, immediately takes up the search to find out who is responsible for his death. She encounters help along the away, in the form of a resourceful homeless man who turns out to be an FBI agent in disguise, investigating possible fraud within the court. Scottoline, an Edgar nominee for her first book, Everywhere That Mary Went, has again pulled together an intriguing cast of characters and a smart mystery to make an exciting, action-packed read. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Closer to Home (Valdemar: The Herald Spy)</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author&nbsp;Mercedes Lackey's&nbsp;Herald Spy series, set in the beloved fantasy world of Valdemar</b><br><br>Mags was once an enslaved orphan living a harsh life in the mines, until the King's Own Herald discovered his talent and trained him as a spy.

It was about an hour to sunset, and although it was getting into autumn, the days here in the heart of Valdemar were still warm and the nights only pleasantly cool. Today had been perfect haying weather, cloudless, dry, and clear, and tonight was going to bring more of the same conditions. The crow approved of haying; it scared a lot of large and tasty insects and even rodents out where they were easy prey for a clever bird. It was certainly good weather for camping, which, it appeared, the owners of a most peculiar caravan were doing. The crow approved of camping, too, and headed in their direction. Caravans needed to be approached with caution, but sometimes there was food. Unwary toddlers could have their rusks snatched. There might be scraps or offal. Rarely, someone who appreciated crows might offer food freely!</p><p><i>Amily chuckled at the crow&#x2019;s thoughts. She was enjoying riding along in his mind; it was purely a one-way excursion, as it was with all the animals whose eyes she used and whose thoughts she spied on. She hadn&#x2019;t told Mags about this Gift yet; she wanted to talk to someone at the Collegia who might have a better insight into it. It wasn&#x2019;t Animal Mindspeech. She couldn&#x2019;t control the creatures she spied on. At the moment it seemed of very little use, and she hadn&#x2019;t had it long.</i></p><p>Such caravans as the one standing below the crow tended to be at one extreme or the other&#x2014;either very drab and utilitarian, the sort of thing used to move goods from one place to another and not meant to attract attention, or the very opposite, gaudily painted and elaborately ornamented. This one was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. neither one, nor the other. It had been painted a plain white, except for the carvings that ornamented the roofline and the doors, and the shutters that could be closed over the windows to protect them from a storm, which had been painted dark blue. But at one point it had surely been painted as gaudily as you please, for there were designs of flowers and vines bleeding through the white paint. Faintly, but definitely there. It looked as if several coats had been applied, too. The original must have been truly powerful paint.</p><p><i>The caravan looked odd from this vantage. And the crow&#x2019;s eyes picked out a lot of details that Amily had missed. Maybe this Gift might be useful for scouting, or even spying, but how would you get the animal in question to go where you wanted, look at what you needed to see, or listen to what you wanted to hear? Amily supposed that you could just </i>search<i> for random creatures that were near what you wanted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but that could end in a lot of frustration.</i></p><p>Two handsome horses of the vanner breed grazed, hobbled, beside it, as did two beautiful white beasts that no one in all of Valdemar would ever mistake for anything other than Companions.</p><p><i>Well, that wasn&#x2019;t quite true. In the course of their Circuit, the six travelers had come across quite a few people who thought Companions were nothing more than white horses. Exceptionally trained white horses, but certainly no more than that. It irritated Mags and infuriated Jakyr, but Amily was used to people seeing only what they expected to see.</i></p><p>The crow found this even more promising, as he circled. He knew these white horses. Their riders were never cruel, often kind, and always well fed enough to offer a bite or two to a crow. The only question now was, did they like crows?</p><p><i>Amily chuckled silently. Of course she liked crows. Sometimes, before Bear had fixed her leg, crows had given her endless hours of amusement. They were among the first birds to come when she tossed bits of food, quickly learned not only to recognize that she wasn&#x2019;t a threat, but to recognize her even at a distance, and their antics made her laugh.</i></p><p>The humans were camped some distance away from the road, and had followed a track between two sheep-meadows to get here. The van was parked beside a neat little building which anyone in Valdemar would recognize as a Waystation, but the four people from the caravan were not making use of it at the moment. The door was closed, with the bar on the outside still in place. There was a well, a proper one, with a stone wall around it and a wooden canopy over it, with a wooden hatch to keep it clean when not in use. And they <i>had</i> made use of that, for the bucket suspended under the canopy was still wet. They were all sitting on rugs spread on the grass around a fire. It appeared that they had gotten their dinner elsewhere, perhaps at an inn further back down the road behind them, and had brought it along to enjoy <i>al fresco</i> here, for the little fire certainly wasn&#x2019;t serving any purpose other than to heat water for tea. Then again, given the young feast displayed on the rugs, there really was no need for a cooking fire now, and there were more than enough leftovers to serve for breakfast.</p><p><i>As the crow circled, his mate following him cautiously, Amily became aware that he really </i>was<i> hungry, and it wasn&#x2019;t just corvid greed. She&#x2019;d seen crows making off with their own body-weight in food and more, taking it elsewhere to cache it against a hungry day, but this fellow had a mostly-empty belly. She resolved to be generous.</i></p><p>Most of the eating seemed to be over with, and letter-reading had begun while there was still light to read by.</p><p><i>Not that the crow knew what &#x201c;letter-reading&#x201d; was. Amily was the one that recognized what they were all doing. Well, all of them but her. She was lying back on the blanket with her hands under the back of her head and her eyes closed. It was </i>very <i>odd seeing herself like this. It was not like looking in a mirror at all.</i></p><p>The crow landed, his mate after him. His mate hung back, though; much more wary of humans than he was. One of the people&#x2014;currently perusing one of a packet of letters&#x2014;was a woman dressed in Bardic Scarlets. She looked to be of late middle-age, not yet starting to go gray, but just beginning to show character-lines in her face.</p><p><i>Melita looks very imposing through a crow&#x2019;s eyes.</i></p><p>A second, much younger woman, as quiet and brown as a sparrow, in fairly ordinary clothing (although her outfit featured breeches rather than a skirt), was lying on her back on the blanket, eyes closed.</p><p><i>Definitely very odd to see myself like this. A little unsettling too.</i></p><p>A third, a man in Herald Whites, about the same age as the first woman but with silver threading through the dark blond of his hair, was opening the last of his letters and gave a surprised chuckle when he saw the sealed envelope contained a second one.</p><p><i>I think I&#x2019;ll pretend to be napping a little longer, this is very interesting.</i></p><p>The fourth human, a young man, dark of eye and hair, but in gray clothing not unlike the Herald&#x2019;s, was packing up the leftovers. The crow gave a tentative <i>caw,</i> and he looked up, grinned and tossed a generous chunk of cheese in the crow&#x2019;s direction, and a second toward the crow&#x2019;s mate.</p><p>Both birds seized the bounty, and flew off. The crow was very well pleased. That cheese was enough to fill his belly for the night, and give plenty of time in the morning to find the next meal.</p><p><i>And I didn&#x2019;t have to be generous after all. Mags anticipated me!</i> Amily opened her eyes and sat up, ready to see what Herald Jakyr had found in his letter that was so amusing.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, Mags,&#x201d; Herald Jakyr said aloud, making Mags, who had been watching the crows fly off with a half-grin on his face, look in his direction. &#x201c;It seems someone found a clever way to track you down without giving you away.&#x201d;</p><p>Mags bit off an exclamation and took the sealed envelope, ripping it almost in half in his haste to get at it. &#x201c;How in&#x2014;&#x201d; Mags said, and then plunged into the content of the several thick sheets of vellum that had been inside. With an amused smile, Amily took over the clearing-up where he had left off.</p><p>&#x201c;Huh. This ain&#x2019;t from&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anybody I know. But it&#x2019;s in Bey&#x2019;s tongue.&#x201d; He looked over the letter, which had very little writing on it. Then his eyes widened, and he pulled a bit of burning branch out of the fire. Holding the flame carefully under the vellum, he warmed each page up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and like magic, as the others watched too, tiny, brown writing appeared between the few scrawled lines.</p><p>&#x201c;Mags, if you know that secret&#x2014;&#x201d; Jakyr said, when he&#x2019;d closed the mouth that had dropped open in surprise.</p><p>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t do us no good,&#x201d; Mags said shortly. &#x201c;Needs a fruit we ain&#x2019;t got.&#x201d; He perused the letter, while Amily picked up the envelope and tried the same trick with it. Her attempt yielded nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Bard Melita (or just &#x201c;Lita&#x201d; to most) asked after a moment, with evident impatience. &#x201c;What is it then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hang on, it&#x2019;s from Bey, and it&#x2019;s in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, it&#x2019;s in Bey&#x2019;s tongue. I have to translate it, then puzzle it out.&#x201d; Mags&#x2019; brows were creased with concentration&#x2014;and then, relaxed with relief. &#x201c;Well, he says the coast is clear, more or less. Nobody from the Sleepgivers is going to be looking for me no more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I assume there&#x2019;s more to this than the ruse we were planning on?&#x201d; Herald Jakyr asked.</p><p>Mags nodded. &#x201c;All right, let me take this one bit at a time. The first thing he writes is that he obviously got home safe. He says, once he got back home, he came up with a pretty fine story about comin&#x2019; across the last of the lot that was supposed to be comin&#x2019; for me at the Bastion, interceptin&#x2019; him at the border to Karse.&#x201d;</p><p>Jakyr nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good, plausible story.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bey&#x2019;s clever that way.&#x201d; Mags puzzled through the next part of the letter. &#x201c;This&#x2019;s why the letter&#x2019;s so long, he&#x2019;s got a mort of things to tell me. All right. He told them all the feller was caught by the Karsites, got wounded and was dyin&#x2019;. Bey gave over his talisman to his pa to prove his tale.&#x201d; Mags scratched his head and looked up with a half-smile of rueful admiration. &#x201c;Reckon he must&#x2019;ve pulled a couple off the bodies afore we all pitched &#x2019;em down the hole in the cave we was livin&#x2019; in. I shoulda thought of doin&#x2019; that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You had more than a few things on your mind,&#x201d; Jakyr reminded him. &#x201c;You also had no idea whether or not they could prove dangerous after the wearer was dead; Bey would know better about that than you. And Bey was practically born in subterfuge.&#x201d;</p><p>Mags shrugged. &#x201c;Aye, well. So, Bey tells &#x2019;em all that this made-up feller told <i>Bey </i>that the bunch that was huntin&#x2019; us killed us all, an&#x2019; the Karsite demons killed the ones comin&#x2019; back to report it. He&#x2019;s pretty pleased by the tale he spun, &#x2019;cause he says they all swallered it, and they reckon to steer well clear of Karse from now on. They don&#x2019;t know nothin&#x2019; about handlin&#x2019; their demons, he says, an&#x2019; there&#x2019;s no reason no more t&#x2019; go that way. He says he also dropped hints that &#x2018;Mags&#x2019; is as common a name hereabouts as say, &#x2018;Daisy&#x2019; or &#x2018;Rose&#x2019; or &#x2018;Perry.&#x2019; So he says I can use the name I&#x2019;m used to. So, that&#x2019;s just the first bit. Give me a bit&#x2019;f time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Bey wrote in a very florid style&#x2014;and obliquely. It would probably take someone who had shared both his memories and his experiences to get the full message, which was, without a doubt, exactly what he had intended.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Mags continued, feeling once again that odd disconnect between the Bey he knew and rather liked, and the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. entirely calculating and crafty fellow that he <i>also</i> knew, and didn&#x2019;t much like. &#x201c;He says his pa was kinda sickish when he left, and by the time he got back, the word about me bein&#x2019; dead and all kinda knocked him sideways. He says he got the feelin&#x2019; his pa was just holdin&#x2019; on to see if Bey had growed up enough to take over. So that pretty much settled him on doin&#x2019; what we talked about, him talkin&#x2019; to that girl he had in mind, an&#x2019; seein&#x2019; if he could count on her at his back an&#x2019; all.&#x201d; He had to chuckle about the next part. &#x201c;She called &#x2019;im a few choice kinds of an idiot, an&#x2019; kissed &#x2019;im, an&#x2019; he gets all coy about it, but seems like she&#x2019;d been chasin&#x2019; after him all this time an&#x2019; he didn&#x2019; have the wit t&#x2019;see it. So they go to his pa an&#x2019; get things all settled. Bey&#x2019;s pa an&#x2019; her pa basically did everything but throw &#x2019;em at what passes fer a priest. An they ain&#x2019;t been married but a month an&#x2019; his pa died.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s&#x2014;terrible!&#x201d; Amily exclaimed, as Lita shook her head. But Mags and Jakyr exchanged a little look, and Mags knew exactly what Jakyr was thinking&#x2014;because he was thinking it himself. <i>I wonder how much Bey had a hand in seeing his pa off to the next world&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>It seemed Dallen was of the same mind. <i>:They are an entire nation&#x2014;small, but a nation&#x2014;of assassins. It seems perfectly likely to me.:</i></p><p>In those memories he had shared with Bey, his cousin&#x2019;s relationship with the head of the Sleepgivers, his father, had been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ambiguous. He absolutely respected the old man. He absolutely was loyal to him. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there was no love there. That had been reserved entirely for Bey&#x2019;s mother, who had died when he was a child. And Bey was ambitious. He had very definite ideas about steering the future of the Sleepgivers, plans that were unlikely to see fruition while his father was alive. <i>Would</i> he have given an old, sick man a little help across the threshold of death?</p><p><i>:He had plenty of practice in doing just that,:</i> Dallen observed.</p><p>Mags sucked his lower lip thoughtfully, and decided to keep his thoughts on the matter between himself and Dallen. &#x201c;Well, Bey says that between that tale he spun up, and that he&#x2019;s now the head of the clan&#x2014;&#x201d; He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>&#x201c;There is no longer anyone interested in verifying that cock-and-bull, far-too-convenient story he told,&#x201d; Jakyr said dryly.</p><p>&#x201c;Pretty much.&#x201d; Mags shrugged. &#x201c;The whole idea of lookin&#x2019; fer me was his Pa&#x2019;s anyway. I&#x2019;ve no doubt a lot of &#x2019;em thought it was daft, tryin&#x2019; to bring back someone that was raised a furriner. The more &#x2019;specially as they lost a <i>lot </i>of fellers tryin&#x2019; t&#x2019;do it. Ended up with a costly contract with Karse they canceled, an&#x2019; that didn&#x2019;t turn out well fer &#x2019;em, neither. Hell, prolly half the clan thinks Bey snuck off t&#x2019;kill me his own self.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And without a doubt, the ones that think that admire him for it.&#x201d; Jakyr reached for a pocket pie he had left warming on a stone next to the fire, as Mags cut a last slice of bread and piled ham and pickled onions on top of it, before Amily could pack the loaf and ham away.</p><p>&#x201c;An&#x2019; if any of &#x2019;em hinted at it, he&#x2019;d go all <i>shocked</i> like.&#x201d; Mags took a big bite of his concoction. &#x201c;Well, t&#x2019; get back t&#x2019; this letter, there&#x2019;s some about how his gal is already workin&#x2019; on a baby. There&#x2019;s a lotta stuff just meant fer me, remindin&#x2019; me of stuff that should be in my head now. &#x2019;E said &#x2019;e waited a decent bit afore arrangin&#x2019; t&#x2019;hand the letter off to someone that&#x2019;d give it to a Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in horsetrader &#x2019;e&#x2019;s got contact with.&#x201d; He shook his head with admiration. &#x201c;Wish&#x2019;t I knew how &#x2019;e managed that. I didn&#x2019; know th&#x2019; Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in went that far.&#x201d;</p><p>Jakyr shrugged. &#x201c;You never know what a Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in is likely to do....</p></p><h2>The Fatigue and Fibromyalgia Solution: The Essential Guide to Overcoming Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia, Made Easy!</h2><p><b><b>The nation&#x2019;s leading expert on chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia offers a practical and concise guide to restoring health and energy.</b></b><p></p><p>Millions of&nbsp;Americans have turned to Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum&#x2019;s landmark <i>From Fatigued to Fantastic</i>, the all-time best-selling book on combating disabling fatigue and fibromyalgia.

Beside the door was a Winchester &#x2019;73, and on the table inside the house were two Walker Colts.<br><br>Facing the cabin were twelve Apaches on ragged calico ponies, and one of the Indians had lifted his hand, palm outward. The Apache sitting the white-splashed bay pony was Cochise.<br><br>Beside Angie were her seven-year-old son Jimmy and her five-year-old daughter Jane.<br><br>Cochise sat his pony in silence; his black, unreadable eyes studied the woman, the children, the cabin, and the small garden. He looked at the two ponies in the corral and the three cows. His eyes strayed to the small stack of hay cut from the meadow, and to the few steers farther up the canyon.<br><br>Three times the warriors of Cochise had attacked this solitary cabin and three times they had been turned back. In all, they had lost seven men, and three had been wounded. Four ponies had been killed. His braves reported that there was no man in the house, only a woman and two children, so Cochise had come to see for himself this woman who was so certain a shot with a rifle and who killed his fighting men.<br><br>These were some of the same fighting men who had outfought, outguessed and outrun the finest American army on record, an army outnumbering the Apaches by a hundred to one. Yet a lone woman with two small children had fought them off, and the woman was scarcely more than a girl. And she was prepared to fight now. There was a glint of admiration in the old eyes that appraised her. The Apache was a fighting man, and he respected fighting blood.<br><br>&#x201c;Where is your man?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He has gone to El Paso.&#x201d; Angie&#x2019;s voice was steady, but she was frightened as she had never been before. She recognized Cochise from descriptions, and she knew that if he decided to kill or capture her it would be done. Until now, the sporadic attacks she had fought off had been those of casual bands of warriors who raided her in passing.<br><br>&#x201c;He has been gone a long time. How long?&#x201d;<br><br>Angie hesitated, but it was not in her to lie. &#x201c;He has been gone four months.&#x201d;<br><br>Cochise considered that. No one but a fool would leave such a woman, or such fine children. Only one thing could have prevented his return. &#x201c;Your man is dead,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Angie waited, her heart pounding with heavy, measured beats. She had guessed long ago that Ed had been killed but the way Cochise spoke did not imply that Apaches had killed him, only that he must be dead or he would have returned.<br><br>&#x201c;You fight well,&#x201d; Cochise said. &#x201c;You have killed my young men.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your young men attacked me.&#x201d; She hesitated, then added, &#x201c;They stole my horses.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your man is gone. Why do you not leave?&#x201d;<br><br>Angie looked at him with surprise. &#x201c;Leave? Why, this is my home. This land is mine. This spring is mine. I shall not leave.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This was an Apache spring,&#x201d; Cochise reminded her reasonably.<br><br>&#x201c;The Apache lives in the mountains,&#x201d; Angie replied. &#x201c;He does not need this spring. I have two children, and I do need it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But when the Apache comes this way, where shall he drink? His throat is dry and you keep him from water.&#x201d;<br><br>The very fact that Cochise was willing to talk raised her hopes. There had been a time when the Apache made no war on the white man. &#x201c;Cochise speaks with a forked tongue,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There is water yonder.&#x201d; She gestured toward the hills, where Ed had told her there were springs. &#x201c;But if the people of Cochise come in peace they may drink at this spring.&#x201d;<br><br>The Apache leader smiled faintly. Such a woman would rear a nation of warriors. He nodded at Jimmy. &#x201c;The small one&#x2014;does he also shoot?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He does,&#x201d; Angie said proudly, &#x201c;and well, too!&#x201d; She pointed to an upthrust leaf of prickly pear. &#x201c;Show them, Jimmy.&#x201d;<br><br>The prickly pear was an easy two hundred yards away, and the Winchester was long and heavy, but he lifted it eagerly and steadied it against the doorjamb as his father had taught him, held his sight an instant, then fired. The bud on top of the prickly pear disintegrated.<br><br>There were grunts of appreciation from the dark-faced warriors. Cochise chuckled. &#x201c;The little warrior shoots well. It is well you have no man. You might raise an army of little warriors to fight my people.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no wish to fight your people,&#x201d; Angie said quietly. &#x201c;Your people have your ways, and I have mine. I live in peace when I am left in peace. I did not think,&#x201d; she added with dignity, &#x201c;that the great Cochise made war on women!&#x201d;<br><br>The Apache looked at her, then turned his pony away. &#x201c;My people will trouble you no longer,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You are the mother of a strong son.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about my two ponies?&#x201d; she called after him. &#x201c;Your young men took them from me.&#x201d;<br><br>Cochise did not turn or look back, and the little cavalcade of riders followed him away. Angie stepped back into the cabin and closed the door. Then she sat down abruptly, her face white, the muscles in her legs trembling.<br><br>When morning came, she went cautiously to the spring for water. Her ponies were back in the corral. They had been returned during the night.<br><br>Slowly, the days drew on. Angie broke a small piece of the meadow and planted it. Alone, she cut hay in the meadow and built another stack. She saw Indians several times, but they did not bother her. One morning, when she opened her door, a quarter of antelope lay on the step, but no Indian was in sight. Several times, during the weeks that followed, she saw moccasin tracks near the spring.<br><br>Once, going out at daybreak, she saw an Indian girl dipping water from the spring. Angie called to her, and the girl turned quickly, facing her. Angie walked toward her, offering a bright red silk ribbon. Pleased, the Apache girl left.<br><br>And the following morning there was another quarter of antelope on her step&#x2014;but she saw no Indian.<br><br>Ed Lowe had built the cabin in West Dog Canyon in the spring of 1871, but it was Angie who chose the spot, not Ed. In Santa Fe they would have told you that Ed Lowe was good-looking, shiftless, and agreeable. He was, also, unfortunately handy with a pistol.<br><br>Angie&#x2019;s father had come from County Mayo to New York and from New York to the Mississippi, where he became a tough, brawling river boatman. In New Orleans, he met a beautiful Cajun girl and married her. Together, they started west for Santa Fe, and Angie was born en route. Both parents died of cholera when Angie was fourteen. She lived with an Irish family for the following three years, then married Ed Lowe when she was seventeen.<br><br>Santa Fe was not good for Ed, and Angie kept after him until they started south. It was Apache country, but they kept on until they reached the old Spanish ruin in West Dog. Here there were grass, water, and shelter from the wind.<br><br>There was fuel, and there were pi�ons and game. And Angie, with an Irish eye for the land, saw that it would grow crops.<br><br>The house itself was built on the ruins of the old Spanish building, using the thick walls and the floor. <br><br>The location had been admirably chosen for defense. The house was built in a corner of the cliff, under the sheltering overhang, so that approach was possible from only two directions, both covered by an easy field of fire from the door and windows.<br><br>For seven months, Ed worked hard and steadily. He put in the first crop, he built the house, and proved himself a handy man with tools. He repaired the old plow they had bought, cleaned out the spring, and paved and walled it with slabs of stone. If he was lonely for the carefree companions of Santa Fe, he gave no indication of it. Provisions were low, and when he finally started off to the south, Angie watched him go with an ache in her heart.<br><br>She did not know whether she loved Ed. The first flush of enthusiasm had passed, and Ed Lowe had proved something less than she had believed. But he had tried, she admitted. And it had not been easy for him. He was an amiable soul, given to whittling and idle talk, all of which he missed in the loneliness of the Apache country. And when he rode away, she had no idea whether she would ever see him again. She never did.<br><br>Santa Fe was far and away to the north, but the growing village of El Paso was less than a hundred miles to the west, and it was there Ed Lowe rode for supplies and seed.<br><br>He had several drinks&#x2014;his first in months&#x2014;in one of the saloons. As the liquor warmed his stomach, Ed Lowe looked around agreeably. For a moment, his eyes clouded with worry as he thought of his wife and children back in Apache country, but it was not in Ed Lowe to worry for long. He had another drink and leaned on the bar, talking to the bartender. All Ed had ever asked of life was enough to eat, a horse to ride, an occasional drink, and companions to talk with. Not that he had anything important to say. He just liked to talk.<br><br>Suddenly a chair grated on the floor, and Ed turned. A lean, powerful man with a shock of uncut black hair and a torn, weather-faded shirt stood at bay. Facing him across the table were three hard-faced young men, obviously brothers.<br><br>Ches Lane did not notice Ed Lowe watching from the bar. He had eyes only for the men facing him. &#x201c;You done that deliberate!&#x201d; The statement was a challenge.<br><br>The broad-chested man on the left grinned through broken teeth. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Ches. I done it deliberate. You killed Dan Tolliver on the Brazos.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He made the quarrel.&#x201d; Comprehension came to Ches. He was boxed, and by three of the fighting, blood-hungry Tollivers.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make no difference,&#x201d; the broad-chested Tolliver said. &#x201c; &#x2018;Who sheds a Tolliver&#x2019;s blood, by a Tolliver&#x2019;s hand must die!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Ed Lowe moved suddenly from the bar. &#x201c;Three to one is long odds,&#x201d; he said, his voice low and friendly. &#x201c;If the gent in the corner is willin&#x2019;, I&#x2019;ll side him.&#x201d;<br><br>Two Tollivers turned toward him. Ed Lowe was smiling easily, his hand hovering near his gun. &#x201c;You stay out of this!&#x201d; one of the brothers said harshly.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in,&#x201d; Ed replied. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you boys light a shuck?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, by&#x2014;!&#x201d; The man&#x2019;s hand dropped for his gun, and the room thundered with sound.<br><br>Ed was smiling easily, unworried as always. His gun flashed up. He felt it leap in his hand, saw the nearest Tolliver smashed back, and he shot him again as he dropped. He had only time to see Ches Lane with two guns out and another Tolliver down when something struck him through the stomach and he stepped back against the bar, suddenly sick.<br><br>The sound stopped, and the room was quiet, and there was the acrid smell of powder smoke. Three Tollivers were down and dead, and Ed Lowe was dying. Ches Lane crossed to him.<br><br>&#x201c;We got &#x2019;em,&#x201d; Ed said, &#x201c;we sure did. But they got me.&#x201d;<br><br>Suddenly his face changed. &#x201c;Oh, Lord in heaven, what&#x2019;ll Angie do?&#x201d; And then he crumpled over on the floor and lay still, the blood staining his shirt and mingling with the sawdust.<br><br>Stiff-faced, Ches looked up. &#x201c;Who was Angie?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;His wife,&#x201d; the bartender told him. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s up northeast somewhere, in Apache country. He was tellin&#x2019; me about her. Two kids, too.&#x201d;<br><br>Ches Lane stared down at the crumpled, used-up body of Ed Lowe. The man had saved his life.<br><br>One he could have beaten, two he might have beaten; three would have killed him. Ed Lowe, stepping in when he did, had saved the life of Ches Lane.<br><br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t say where?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>Ches Lane shoved his hat back on his head. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s northeast of here?&#x201d;<br><br>The bartender rested his hands on the bar. &#x201c;Cochise,&#x201d; he said. . . .<br><br>For more than three months, whenever he could rustle the grub, Ches Lane quartered the country over and back. The trouble was, he had no lead to the location of Ed Lowe&#x2019;s homestead. An examination of Ed&#x2019;s horse revealed nothing. Lowe had bought seed and ammunition, and the seed indicated a good water supply, and the ammunition implied trouble. But in that country there was always trouble.<br><br>A man had died to save his life, and Ches Lane had a deep sense of obligation. Somewhere that wife waited, if she was still alive, and it was up to him to find her and look out for her. He rode northeast, cutting for sign, but found none. Sandstorms had wiped out any hope of back-trailing Lowe. Actually, West Dog Canyon was more east than north, but this he had no way of knowing.<br><br>North he went, skirting the rugged San Andreas Mountains. Heat baked him hot, dry winds parched his skin. His hair grew dry and stiff and alkali-whitened. He rode north, and soon the Apaches knew of him. He fought them at a lonely water hole, and he fought them on the run. They killed his horse, and he switched his saddle to the spare and rode on. They cornered him in the rocks, and he killed two of them and escaped by night.<br><br>They trailed him through the White Sands, and he left two more for dead. He fought fiercely and bitterly, and would not be turned from his quest. He turned east through the lava beds and still more east to the Pecos. He saw only two white men, and neither knew of a white woman.<br><br>The bearded man laughed harshly. &#x201c;A woman alone? She wouldn&#x2019;t last a month! By now the Apaches got her, or she&#x2019;s dead. Don&#x2019;t be a fool! Leave this country before you die here.&#x201d;<br><br>Lean, wind-whipped, and savage, Ches Lane pushed on. The Mescaleros cornered him in Rawhide Draw and he fought them to a standstill. Grimly, the Apaches clung to his trail.<br><br>The sheer determination of the man fascinated them. Bred and born in a rugged and lonely land, the Apaches knew the difficulties of survival; they knew how a man could live, how he must live. Even as they tried to kill this man, they loved him, for he was one of their own.<br><br>Lane&#x2019;s jeans grew ragged. Two bullet holes were added to the old black hat. The slicker was torn; the saddle, so carefully kept until now, was scratched by gravel and brush. At night he cleaned his guns and by day he scouted the trails. Three times he found lonely ranch houses burned to the ground, the buzzard- and coyote-stripped bones of their owners lying nearby.<br><br>Once he found a covered wagon, its canvas flopping in the wind, a man lying sprawled on the seat with a pistol near his hand. He was dead and his wife was dead, and their canteens rattled like empty skulls.<br><br>Leaner every day, Ches Lane pushed on. He camped one night in a canyon near some white oaks. He heard a hoof click on stone and he backed away from his tiny fire, gun in hand.<br><br>The riders were white men, and there were two of them. Joe Tompkins and Wiley Lynn were headed west, and Ches Lane could have guessed why. They were men he had known before, and he told them what he was doing.<br><br>Lynn chuckled. He was a thin-faced man with lank yellow hair and dirty fingers. &#x201c;Seems a mighty strange way to get a woman. There&#x2019;s some as comes easier.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This ain&#x2019;t for fun,&#x201d; Ches replied shortly. &#x201c;I got to find her.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Art of Horror: An Illustrated History (Applause Books)</h2><p>Amazingly, there has never been a book quite like <i>The Art of Horror</i> &#x2013; a celebration of frightful images, compiled and presented by some of the genre's most respected names. While acknowledging the beginnings of horror-related art in legends and folk tales, the focus of the book is on how the genre has presented itself to the world since the creations of Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley first became part of the public consciousness in the 19th century. It's all here: from early engravings &#x2013; via dust jackets, book illustrations, pulp magazines, movie posters, comic books, and paintings &#x2013; to today's artists working entirely in the digital realm.<br><br>Editor Stephen Jones and his stellar team of contributors have sourced visuals from archives and private collections (including their own) worldwide, ensuring an unprecedented selection that is accessible to those discovering the genre, while also including many images that will be rare and unfamiliar to even the most committed fan.<br><br>From the shockingly lurid to the hauntingly beautiful &#x2013; including images of vampires, werewolves, zombies, ghosts, demons, serial killers, alien invaders, and more &#x2013; every aspect of the genre is represented in ten themed chapters. Quotes from artists/illustrators, and a selection from writers and filmmakers, are featured throughout.</p><p>STEPHEN JONES is a Hugo Award nominee and the winner of three World Fantasy Awards, three International Horror Guild Awards, four Bram Stoker Awards, twenty-one British Fantasy Awards, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the World Horror Association. One of Britain&#x2019;s most acclaimed horror and dark fantasy writers and editors, he has more than 130 books to his credit. He lives in London.''Heavily-bounded and excellently printed by Applause (a cinema and theater related imprint of Hal Leonard Corporation), The Art of Horror is nearly as much of a work of art as the many pieces it aims to highlight. With the downward spiral that print publication has been going through, this book leaves faith that there are still plenty of quality releases on the rise. That quality only continues once inside. Each of the book's 250-plus pages are nicely illustrated and laid out, printed on a heavy stock, lightly glossed paper that accentuates harrowing images contained within.... While on first appearance it may seem so, The Art of Horror [is] not your standard coffee table style art book (which the world is in no short supply of). Jones elevates the book by adding a strong critical component. Rather than present a hodgepodge of pieces, Jones has collected the works into ten carefully curated sections, taking it a step farther by assigning each section a writer to add to it a cultural and historical context of whom, many are often leading critics of their given fields.... Even the most seasoned veteran of horror art history will be sure to find a few new pieces amongst the collection. Halloween may have passed but The Art of Horror is a piece you'll want to keep out all year round.'' -Diabolique Magazine <br><br> ''There have been heavily illustrated books that dealt with [horror] fragments some devoted only to 20th century art, others only to pulp magazine illustrations or genre film poster art; and horror was often mixed with heavy doses of science fiction and fantasy. None had the ambition with which veteran editor Stephen Jones approached this subject. The result is The Art of Horror: 256 large-format pages containing an in-depth history, as well as roughly 400 of the most haunting examples of horror art, including classical paintings and engravings, dust jackets, book illustrations, pulp magazine covers, film posters, comic books, new original paintings and digital artwork.'' --Rue Magazine <br><br> ''A fine addition to your coffee table or coffin lid, The Art of Horror: An Illustrated History, edited by Stephen Jones, is a horror connoisseur's choice of movie posters, comic books, paperback and dust jacket art, pulp magazine covers, and ancient and contemporary art that gleefully dwells on the morbid predilections of the frightening genre so many fans clamor for yet know little about.'' --Zombos' Closet<br><br>''The Art of Horror: An Illustrated History landed on CL's desk at a time when appreciation of vintage horror is at an all-time high, evidenced by Second Screen's recent showing of Dario Argento's Suspiria and del Toro's nostalgic and sweeping Gothic romance Crimson Peak. The marvelously massive anthology weighs nearly 4 pounds and boasts a lovely matte paper stock with impeccable image quality. Editor Stephen Jones has curated more than 500 fantastical and creepy images with a beautifully penned foreword by Neil Gaiman (a tease, but a tasty one, for sure). Beasts, demons and ghosts are brought into context, offering a great primer for teens and pre-teens and non-horror enthusiasts. Hardcore horror lovers may gain a little less information-wise from the book but will have a beautiful picture book to escape life's real-life's horrors with.'' -Creative Loafing<br><br> ''The Art of Horror has appeal to fans of horror films, comics, literature, and pulp magazines. Jones did a superb job of bringing together some of the foremost authorities on horror and matching them to their particular specialties. This is a book that any horror connoisseur will want to add to their personal library.'' --SciFi Movie Page <br><br> ''While we normally think of horror in terms of fiction or film, artists' illustrations for books, magazines and movie posters have been giving hideous life to this ever-popular genre for more than a century. Arranged by monster, each section boasts an essay by a prominent scholar, including, among others, David J. Skal on vampires, Kim Newman on werewolves and shapeshifters, Richard Dalby on ghosts, S.T. Joshi on cosmic horrors, Lisa Morton on witches and demons and Robert Weinberg on aliens. Still, the pictures here are, so to speak, to die for. Featured, among scores of others, are Margaret Brundage's iconic Bat-Woman (from the cover of Weird Tales), Hannes Bok's even more sexy Fox Woman, Bernie Wrightson's Frankenstein confronting his creature and Michael Komarck's Cthulhu, depicted rising from the ocean depths. This beautifully produced books is, in short, the stuff that nightmares on Elm Street or before Christmas are made of.'' - The Washington Post <br><br> ''A motherlode of fascinating information, The Art of Horror includes much that has been seldom seen or heard of.'' --Shepherd Express<br><br>''If you're a fan of things that go bump in the night, the works of H.P. Lovecraft, or anything related to the world of horror for that matter, this is the book for you. Even if you don't have much knowledge on the subject, this book is certainly something worth checking out. There are images that have been seen many times before, but there are also many that have rarely seen or have never been seen before. It's a terrific, in-depth look into the world of horror and art.'' - Examiner <br><br> ''The Art of Horror: An Illustrated History by Stephen Jones is a visual feast aimed at lovers of horror. It contains an endlessly impressive selection of horror art since the late 19th century. Every page deserves multiple visits.'' - Kirkus Reviews<br><br> ''A wonderful book that looks far more expensive than it's pricetag suggests, just holding it in your hands feels like something truly special, a wonderful item that compliments a wonderful genre.'' --Back to the Movies<br><br> ''The mother of all creepy coffee table books, Stephen Jones' THE ART OF HORROR is a jaw-dropping collection of art charting the illustrated history of the genre in art, film, literature and international popular culture. The wildest collection of odds, ends, essentials and esoterica I've ever seen collected in one place. From Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books.'' --Shock Till You Drop <br><br> ''First and foremost, it's a gorgeous volume measuring a big ten by eleven inches. It features heavy gloss pages designed with stunning images and well-researched topics for each chapter. But it's certainly the art that you'll buy it for, and it's well worth it. As a long-time fan I've seen a LOT of horror, but this book is packed full of images and artists I've never heard of.'' --Horror Talk</p><h2>An Exorcist: More Stories</h2><p><p>Following up his international best-selling book,&nbsp;<i>An Exorcist Tells His Story</i>, Fr. Gabriele Amorth, the renowned chief exorcist of Rome, expands on some of the key topics of his previous book, covering important details about demonic or occult issues. He uses concrete examples from his own experiences and those of other exorcists to illustrate and substantiate his points.</p><p>Since satanic sects, occultism, sTances, fortune-tellers and astrologers are so widespread today, Father Amorth asks the question why is it so difficult today to find an exorcist, or a priest who is an expert in this field? The example and the teaching of Christ is very clear, as is the tradition of the Church. But today's Catholics are often misinformed.</p><p>Exorcisms are reserved for appointed priests, while all believers can make prayers of liberation. What is the difference? What norms must be followed? What problems are still open and unresolved in this field?</p><p>The new book by Father Amorth answers these and many other questions, supporting his discourse with a rich exposition of recent facts. A valuable, practical and instructive manual for priests and lay people, on how to help many who are suffering.</p></p><p></p><h2>Henry And Mudge In The Sparkle Days</h2><p>Henry and his dog Mudge experience the sparkly joys of winter in this fifth Ready-to-Read book of their adventures.<br><br>Henry and his 180-pound dog Mudge are best friends forever.

Connell's groundbreaking text, which has become a classic work on the nature and construction of masculine identity. In its first edition, <i>Masculinities </i>provided one of the most important voices in feminist scholarship by men. Connell argued that there is no such thing as a single concept of masculinity, but, rather, that many different masculinities exist, each associated with different positions of power. In a world in which gender order continues to extend privilege to men over women, but that also raises difficult issues for men and boys, Connell's account is more pertinent than ever.<br><br> In the new edition's substantial new introduction and conclusion, Connell discusses the development of masculinity studies in the ten years since the book's initial publication. She explores global gender relations, new theories, and practical uses of masculinity research. Looking to the future, her new concluding chapter addresses the politics of masculinities, and the implications of masculinity research as a way of understanding current world issues. Against the backdrop of an increasingly divided world, one that is presently dominated by neo-conservative politics, Connell's account highlights a series of compelling questions about the future of human society.<br><br> This second edition of Connell's classic book will be essential reading for students taking courses on masculinities and gender studies and will be of interest to students and scholars across the humanities and social sciences.</p><p>FROM THE PREVIOUS EDITION:<br><br>"Clearly written and sophisticated, this book presents Connell's ideas about males and the social phenomena that interact with gender."&#x2015;<i>Choice</i><br><br>"Connell&#x2019;s book is the fundamental study on masculinity as a formative factor on modern social inequality, and also of the most important books in the social sciences in recent years."&#x2015;<i>Journal for the Study of British Cultures</i><br><br>"A wonderful book; engagingly written, broadly researched, and politically useful. It is certainly one of the best of the recent, to use Connell's witty phrase, 'books about men.'"&#x2015;<i>Australian Journal of Political Science</i>&#34;Bob Connell is the most fertile, astute and influential analyst of the myriad and messy meanings of masculinities on the planet. &#34;The Men and the Boys boldly extends the scope, depth and power of the foundational work he laid in Masculinities to address the most urgent and difficult questions about global gender and injustice of our time.

It is certainly a Christian&#x2019;s greatest hope during these difficult times. The Bible warns us that the last days will be tumultuous&#x2015;wars and rumors of wars will spread (Matthew 24:6). In our age, the world seems to be spinning out of control, creating fear, confusion, and uncertainty. In addition to violence, pestilence, and epidemics, the Bible predicts a great &#x201c;falling away&#x201d; from God in the end times. Bible teachers call that &#x201c;the great apostasy.&#x201d; Are we seeing evidence today in the church of this massive rejection of sound and wholesome teaching? Bestselling authors Mark Hitchcock and Jeff Kinley team up to examine the evidence from the teachers of our time.

Prayer is our connection with God--our strength, our bridge to heaven! It is when &#34;men begin to call upon the name of the Lord&#34; that they find Him. We are told that He &#34;hearest prayer.&#34; What a promise the is! As we prey, the Holy Spirit Himself unites in our petition s and &#34;maketh intercession for us.&#34; We are not along in the battle of life; all heaven is on our side! Each of these 80 sections (containing one to three pages each) are compiled from Ellen G. White&#39;s writings. Her quotes bring together in one book all that she had to say on prayer.

She is credited with having written 100,000 manuscript pages. This remarkable legacy to the church could alone have occupied Ellen White's entire life, had she dedicated her time to little else but writing. However, her service for the church embraces much more than writing. Her diaries tell of her public work, her travels, her personal labor, hostessing, contacts with neighbors, as well as of her being a mother and housewife. God blessed her abundantly in these activities. Her ambitions and concerns, her satisfactions and joys, her sorrows--her whole life--were for the advancement of the cause she loved.<br> <br> Ellen G White is reputed to be the most translated woman author and the most translated author in American history. After a full life dedicated to the service of God and others, she died on July 16, 1915, confidently trusting in Him whom she believed.</p><h2>So Many Cats!</h2><p>A counting story in verse shows how easily one sad and lonely cat can turn into twelve.</p><p>Ellen Weis Goldstrom (d. 2011) illustrated or authored 24 children&#39;s books over the course of her career.Kindergarten-Grade 3-So Many Cats by Beatrice Schenk de Regniers (Clarion, 1985) is a charming counting story written in rhyming verse that tells how a household with one cat comes to have 12 cats. The narration by Shelly Brown begins with a verbal description of where to begin in order to help beginning readers locate the first page of text. Pleasant background music and sound effects accompany the narration. Side 1 of the tape includes page turn signals that sound like a cat's meow; side 2 is the story told uninterrupted. The book's illustrations by Ellen Weiss are delightful and will appeal to young children. Teachers will find this story beneficial as a math concept book, which introduces counting from one to 12, as well as an introduction to addition and word problems.

Ogres!: A Feasting Frenzy from A to Z</em> by Nicholas Heller, and <em>A Creepy Countdown</em> by Charlotte Huck, lives in New York City.Ages 3^-7. In this sequel to <i>Mowing</i> (1994) and <i>No Foal Yet</i> (1995), Nora helps Gramp make maple syrup and sugar. The two collect sap from the maple trees and transport it on a horse-drawn rig to their sugarhouse, where the sticky liquid boils for many hours in a long pan atop a special wood-burning stove. At just the right time, they pour off some thick maple syrup, leaving the rest to boil longer and turn into maple sugar. This fictionalized portrayal allows Nora to take center stage in the sugaring process, and although adults may question the safety of Nora's standing so close to an open pan of boiling syrup, listeners will benefit from a close-up view of the entire procedure. Smith's watercolor-and-colored-pencil illustrations convey the close relationship between Nora and her grandparents as well as each stage of the sugaring. Aimed at a younger audience than Kathryn Lasky's <i>Sugaring Time</i> (1983), this can be paired with Diane Burns' <i>Sugaring Season</i> (1990) or the sugaring chapters from Wilder's <i>Little House in the Big Woods</i> (1987). <i>Kay Weisman</i></p><h2>The Inhabitant of the Lake &amp; Other Unwelcome Tenants [Trade Paperback]</h2><p><b>SYNOPSIS</b> <p> The influence of H. P. Lovecraft spans the centuries. Several of his correspondents who were writers learned by imitating him. The early tales of Robert Bloch and Henry Kuttner read very much like Lovecraft, while others of his friends Donald Wandrei, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard and August Derleth among them incorporated his ideas and myths into their fiction. Bloch and Frank Belknap Long even wrote tributes to him that used him, barely disguised, as a character. </p> <p> After Lovecraft s death August Derleth took control of his mythos, adding to and organising it more systematically than its creator ever had. Derleth was a jealous guardian of Lovecraft s reputation, and insisted on vetting any stories by new writers that used the mythos. Few found his favour until 1961, when a Liverpudlian fifteen-year-old sent him the first drafts of several Lovecraftian tales. The outcome was a ten-year professional relationship and the appearance in 1964 of the first book of previously unpublished Lovecraftian fiction for five years. It was <i>The Inhabitant of the Lake</i>. </p> <p> This fiftieth anniversary edition reprints that book in full, including the original introduction. It also includes the first drafts of all the tales that were rewritten before publication and reproduces Derleth s editorial responses to the stories. </p> <p> This edition is superbly illustrated by Randy Broecker in the great tradition of <i>Weird Tales</i>. </p> <p> <b>Customers should note that this Drugstore Indian Press edition includes the first drafts of the stories plus August Derleth's letters, Randy Broecker's illustrations and the author's Afterword.</b> </p></p><p></p><h2>Blackpentecostal Breath: The Aesthetics of Possibility (Commonalities)</h2><p><p><b>WINNER OF THE JUDY TSOU CRITICAL RACE STUDIES AWARD!</b><br><br>In this profoundly innovative book, Ashon T.

Why is there a universe <em>at all</em>? Why is there <em>any</em> life on Earth? <em>How</em> is it that discoverable scientific laws operate in the universe? Swinburne uses scientific reasoning to argue that the best answers to these questions are given by the existence of God. The picture of the universe that science gives us is completed by God. This updated edition features a new, stronger argument as to why theism does--and materialism does not-provide a very simple ultimate explanation of the world. And Swinburne also now examines the idea of the possible existence of many other universes, and its relevance to his arguments from the fine-tuning of our universe to the existence of God.

There were three of them, all men in their early twenties wearing hoodie sweatshirts. As they ran up to the counter, two of them pulled out handguns. Janelle was petrified. In a flash, she realized that she was unarmed, and that her husband, Jacob&#x2014; who <i>was </i>armed&#x2014;was out of sight in the back of the store, running the panel saw. He was cutting up a piece of plywood for a customer. The noise of the saw would drown out her voice, even if she were to shout for help.<br><br>The shortest of the three men tossed a pillowcase to Janelle and ordered, &#x201c;Fill it! Dump the cash tray and the cash <i>under </i>the tray in, too.&#x201d; She quickly opened the cash register and complied. As she handed the sack back to the man, one of the others, with an acne-scarred complexion, hissed, &#x201c;You pick up the phone in less than five minutes and I&#x2019;ll come back here next week and empty this gun into you.&#x201d;<br><br>The three men fled just as Janelle heard the sound of the vertically mounted Skilsaw winding down. She ran toward her husband in a panicked dash. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve just been robbed,&#x201d; she shouted over the noise. Jake hesitated only for a moment before unholstering his SIG pistol. He started walking toward the front of the store, cautiously. Behind him, Janelle said, &#x201c;Three young black guys, all wearing hoodies. Two of them have guns.&#x201d; Jake glanced at the open cash register and the register&#x2019;s empty cash tray sitting at an odd angle.<br><br>They heard tires screeching outside the store. Jake picked up his pace and jogged to the hardware store&#x2019;s front entrance. As he ran out the door, he caught just a glimpse of an older Ford Taurus racing down the street. He stopped and lowered his pistol. Then he noticed that his hands were shaking.<br><br>&#x201c;Call 911! Black Ford Taurus sedan. Tell &#x2019;em they&#x2019;re headed south on State Road 19!&#x201d; he shouted to Janelle. Then muttering to himself, he added, &#x201c;And they&#x2019;ll be lost in the traffic and down in Orlando before the cops even get out of the donut shop.&#x201d;<br><br>Their store had been burglarized the year before, so they&#x2019;d added bars to the windows and beefed up the back door. But they hadn&#x2019;t expected an armed robbery during the day. To Janelle, robberies had seemed like something that happened only to jewelry shops, liquor stores, and gas stations&#x2014;and then mainly in Jacksonville or Orlando.<br><br>The robbery made the Altmillers seriously reconsider security for their small hardware store. The store had been established by Jake&#x2019;s grandfather, who had bought the 2.5-acre lot for just twelve hundred dollars during World War II. Situated south of the Dora Canal, it had been in continuous operation since 1946. It was also the last family-owned, independent hardware store in Lake County. All of the others had long since been affiliated with chains like Ace or True Value, or run out of business by the big-box giants like Home Depot and Lowe&#x2019;s. And while they&#x2019;d suffered their share of shoplifting, this was the first time they&#x2019;d ever been robbed at gunpoint.<br><br>A few days after the robbery, the Altmillers added four miniature security cameras that recorded directly to their PC&#x2019;s hard drive. One of these cameras was deliberately set up at a low angle to avoid the classic &#x201c;view of the top of the perp&#x2019;s baseball cap.&#x201d; Another camera was aimed at the front entrance, and contrasting strips of colored tape were added at one-foot intervals running up both sides of the door frame. When seen in surveillance footage, these markings would allow them to approximate the height of a suspect after a robbery.<br><br>Most importantly, Janelle and Jake began to carry their pistols daily. They both took the three-day fighting pistol immersion course taught by Florida Firearms Training in Okeechobee. This was Janelle&#x2019;s first formal firearms instruction. For Jake, who had taken two previous classes by other instructors, the comprehensive course made him realize how much he still had to learn. They both made a point of doing monthly practice shooting sessions at the local range on Sunday afternoons when the store was closed.<br><br>Janelle stood just five feet two inches tall&#x2014;eight inches shorter than her husband. Her rounded hips and short trunk made most hip holsters uncomfortable for her. Drawing her pistol from a hip holster was ungainly because of the short distance between the top of the holster and her armpit. She tried several types of right-handed holsters before settling on a modified Kydex cross-draw holster made by Multi Holsters. She concealed it with the blue Altmiller&#x2019;s Hardware logo canvas vests that they wore to identify store employees. By wearing the vest unbuttoned, she could draw the pistol quickly if needed. On the few occasions when a customer caught a glimpse of the holstered pistol, it usually triggered compliments rather than ridicule. Florida, after all, had one million concealed carry pistol permits&#x2014;the most of any state. There was a reason it was nicknamed the Gunshine State.<br><b>Doubts </b><br><br>&#x201c;Ever since the religion of Islam appeared in the world, the espousers of it . . . have been as wolves and tigers to all other nations, rending and tearing all that fell into their merciless paws, and grinding them with their iron teeth; that numberless cities are raised from the foundation, and only their name remaining; that many countries, which were once as the garden of God, are now a desolate wilderness; and that so many once numerous and powerful nations are vanished from the earth!

He had just survived a big layoff. This had been the first time the company had let go more than just assemblers. Two friends from his department&#x2014;one from New Zealand and one from Singapore&#x2014;were the company&#x2019;s only foreign-born employees. Without warning, they had been told to pack up the personal contents of their cubicles and were escorted out the door. It soon became apparent that all of the others singled out in the layoff were non-Muslims, leaving the with a one hundred percent Muslim staff. The circumstances of the layoff troubled Wulandari.<br><br>The next day, word came of a lucrative new video camera assembly contract. <i>Why would the company need to lay off anyone when they&#x2019;ve just received a new contract? </i>Wulandari wondered. Everyone else seemed happy to still have their jobs, so they didn&#x2019;t ask many questions.<br><br>While reviewing the drawing specifications for the new assembly contract, Wulandari noticed that the drawings were incomplete. The diagrams showed only one half of a clamshell housing marked camera case, a battery, and a digital timer. The large round center section of the housing was a blank spot in the drawings, marked simply as camera position (tbd). The empty space also seemed unusually large for a digital camera, given their recent miniaturization. Even stranger, there were no molded projections in the plastic to hold a camera in place.<br><br>All of the parts for the assembly project came in from several other subcontractors: 252 unmarked gray plastic cases from an injection molding company in Tasikmalaya, boxes of aluminum screws from a fastener supply company in Banjarsari, 252 five-year-life 48-volt lithium manganese dioxide batteries sourced from China, bundles of green LEDs from a parts vendor in Jakarta Tangerang, and 252 generic programmable digital timers made by Omron.<br><br>The battery specification also struck Wulandari as unusual. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries would have been a better choice for a camera system. <i>Why would they specify a 48 volt disposable battery, and why did they need one with such a high voltage and amp hour rating? </i>He surmised that they wanted to emplace &#x201c;set and forget&#x201d; espionage cameras for several years, but the specifications still seemed incongruous.<br><br>When the 252 timers arrived, he grew even more suspicious. They were packed in cardboard boxes labeled omron automation&#x2014;a major electronics company in Jakarta Selatan&#x2014;but the timers themselves were completely unmarked. Every other electronics subassembly he&#x2019;d ever worked with had carried at least a maker&#x2019;s name and part number. The lack of any markings further piqued his curiosity.<br><br>The camera boxes had only a pair of 48-volt DC power input wires, a mini-USB controller port, two pairs of 20-centimeter-long 48-volt output wires, and another 40-centimeter pair of thinner leads in a contrasting color, with smaller connectors that were attached to the low-current, low-voltage green status light LEDs. These were left dangling for later assembly, which was not common practice.<br><br>Wulandari asked his supervisor why they were doing only part of the assembly, but the senior engineer offered no explanation. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. We are just the subcontractor.&#x201d; And when Wulandari asked about the customer, his boss said, &#x201c;They tell me it is a secret project for the BIN. I think it must be some kind of spy camera.&#x201d; The Indonesian Badan Intelijen Negara&#x2014;the Indonesian equivalent of the CIA&#x2014;was notoriously secretive. Another employee, however, was told that it was a project for the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space or Lembaga Penerbangan dan Antariksa Nasional (LAPAN). Wulandari didn&#x2019;t know who to believe.<br><br>Wulandari also raised concerns about the flimsy aluminum screws that were specified for mounting the camera&#x2019;s timer and battery, as they would be easily deformed when the cameras were eventually serviced. Once again, his concerns were brushed aside. &#x201c;I have no idea why aluminum. That is just what they ordered.&#x201d;<br><br>After all of the parts had arrived, the assembly of the cameras was completed in just one week and resulted in a very profitable contract for the company. The 252 camera housings&#x2014;with batteries and timers installed and LEDs attached&#x2014;were then packaged and sent by truck to another small company farther south in Banten Province, ostensibly for installation of the cameras.<br><br>The camera case contract was soon forgotten by most of the company&#x2019;s employees. But Wulandari&#x2019;s doubts about it persisted until almost three years later, when the camera cases made news headlines, erasing all doubt about their true purpose.<br><b>Life In Oz </b><br><br>&#x201c;A society that does not defend itself is doomed.

They had already lowered ten of the high-explosive seismic charges down the previously drilled shot holes, and this would be the eleventh of the day. Sweat was dripping off the end of Chuck Nolan&#x2019;s nose. Randall &#x201c;Rabbit&#x201d; Burroughs, one of Chuck&#x2019;s &#x201c;jug hustler&#x201d; assistants, lifted the thirty-four-pound yellow plastic tube of Geoprime dBX explosives to the mouth of the hole. The thousands of feet of cables and geophones, or jugs, laid out by the team over the rough, dry terrain would capture the reflected acoustic energy released from these explosive charges and provide an image of the underlying geologic strata.<br><br>Looking up from the reel of thin two-strand electrical wire that was resting in the payout stand, his other assistant, Bruce Drake, said, &#x201c;Hey, mate, you forgot the suspension cord.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Burroughs asked.<br><br>Just then, the tube slipped from Randall&#x2019;s sweaty fingers. The five-inch-diameter plastic canister briefly lodged at a slight angle in the top of the bore, but then straightened itself and continued its fall before Burroughs could grasp it again. The wire payout wheel spun rapidly with a loud whirring sound.<br><br>Chuck yelled, &#x201c;Run!&#x201d; at the top of his lungs.<br><br>Run they did, in three different directions. They were still sprinting and just ten yards from the bore when the explosives tube hit the bottom of the hole. The sharp jolt of bottoming in the bore set off the blasting caps. Instantly, the main charge detonated. An enormous cloud of red dust loomed up from the bore and from the soil near it. The ground lurched beneath their feet as dirt and rocks came raining down around them. Chuck felt at least two clods or small rocks hit his yellow plastic bump cap, and one glanced off his shoulder. Another hit the side of Chuck&#x2019;s Jeep.<br><br>After running a few more yards, Chuck stopped and looked back. As the cloud of red dust started to dissipate, he could see that his assistants were still in one piece and running. Even though his ears were ringing, Chuck started laughing uproariously, greatly relieved that they had escaped the blast unscathed.<br><br>Drake stopped and yelled at Burroughs. &#x201c;You mongrel! You&#x2019;re a few sandwiches short of a picnic!&#x201d;<br><br>After catching his breath, Drake added, &#x201c;You better keep running, Rabbit!&#x201d;<br><br>Still laughing, Chuck muttered to himself, &#x201c;Just another day of oil fossicking in the Merry Old Land of Oz.&#x201d;<br><br>Despite their proximity to the blast, there was no damage to the trucks, other than a shattered passenger-side rearview mirror on Chuck&#x2019;s Jeep. Rabbit Burroughs had been complaining of a headache all day, and had twice mentioned that he thought he was coming down with the flu. That was his explanation for failing to attach the nylon parachute cord that was normally used to slowly lower the seismic testing charges. They laughed off the incident on their drive back to Darwin, although Rabbit Burroughs spent the next three days sick in bed with the flu.<br><br>Two weeks later, the replacement side-mirror assembly Chuck had ordered arrived. He bolted it on without the assistance of the dealership, but when he&#x2019;d finished, he was confronted with a strange sight: His perennially filthy Jeep had one <i>clean</i> mirror housing. It was enough to compel Chuck to take his truck to the car wash for a long-overdue cleaning.<br><br>The self-service car wash on Vanderlin Drive was run by a genial man in his thirties. By his looks, Chuck assumed the man was half Aborigine. Instead of being coin-operated like the car wash in his small hometown in Texas, this one used credit cards for payment. Washing the accumulated red dirt from the truck took three full cycles.<br><br>Chuck wore his cowboy hat as protection from the glaring sun. As he worked, he hummed the tune to the song &#x201c;I&#x2019;m So Ronery&#x201d; from a political parody movie featuring puppets, which he had seen many years before. Just as he was finishing up the last cycle, he heard a woman&#x2019;s voice from behind him. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s T-T?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>He turned to see a tall young woman with curly, sandy-brown hair, wearing short pants and a simple blouse. Her index finger was pointing to the large red decal on his truck&#x2019;s back window, with overlapping capital <i>T</i>s.<br><br>Momentarily flummoxed at the unexpected sight of the woman, Chuck answered haltingly, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s, uh, Texas Tech, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Mimicking his Texan accent, she asked, &#x201c;Are you new in these parts?&#x201d; Chuck laughed. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ve been here about eight months. I&#x2019;m in the oil business.&#x201d;<br><br>Dropping the accent, the young woman said, &#x201c;A genuine Texas oilman.

What is the secret of Mary Magdalene s power? Who were the female disciples of jeshua? Did Jeshua and Mary Magdalene have a child? How can we understand the New Children now being born? What changes will the New Consciousness bring into our lives? This is the story of the Essenes and the female disciples of Jeshua who were deliberately marginalised and written out of the record. This book focuses on the partnership of Jeshua and Mary Magdalene, and culminates in the work of the Crystal Children who are just now being born. This fascinating story was revealed through the process of past life regression and through the insight of an angelic being called Alariel. This is the inner history or our planet as it has never been told before. A narrative to inspire the spirit and warm the heart.</p><p>Stuart Wilson is a writer on new perspectives and the author of the best-selling name dictionary Simply the Best Baby Name Book. His perceptions of the new consciousness have been developed through 30 years of working with groups committed to personal growth. For nine years, Stuart co-focalized (with Joanna Prentis) the Starlight Centre in the West of England, a centre dedicated to healing and the transformation of consciousness. He writes about this period: It was inspiring and fascinating but also exhausting! A stream of visitors came in to the Centre, mainly from the United States and Australia, but some also from Europe. We had an amazing and mind-bending time sitting at the feet of internationally respected spiritual teachers and workshop leaders. Part of the work of the Centre was research into past lives, and this led to his collaboration with Joanna to write The Essenes, Children of the Light (published by Ozark Mountain Publishing in 2005.) Based on the past life regression of 7 subjects, this book reveals Essene links with the Druids, the existence of a secret Core Group around Jesus, and contacts with the Order of Melchizedek. Joanna Prentis: I was born in Bangalore in southern India. When I was nearly three, my family returned to Scotland where I spent my childhood and teenage years. After leaving school, I traveled extensively, married and lived in Hong Kong for two years and then ten years in the bush in Western Australia, where my three daughters were born. It was there that my interest began in alternative medicine and education, organic farming, metaphysics and meditation. With a local nurse, we ran a Homeopathic and Radionic practice. I returned to the UK in 1979 and later trained as a Montessori teacher, educating my two youngest daughters, Katinka and Larissa, at home for a few years. I now have three beautiful grandchildren. I did several healing courses and have a foundation diploma in Humanistic Psychology. I also trained with Ursula Markham and have a diploma in Hypnotherapy and Past Life Therapy. With my eldest daughter Tatanya, I set up the Starlight Centre in 1988, a centre for healing and the expansion of consciousness. Over the years, Tatanya has introduced us to many innovative techniques and interesting people. In 1999, we closed the Centre to focus on producing our books. I continue with my Past Life work, and readers now connect with us from all over the world.The title of this book belies its wide-ranging subject matter. It does indeed give insight into the true power of Mary Magdalene, and the faxcinating story of the female desciples. But it is a veritable treasurehouse of so much more: rituals of the ancient Egyptian Mystery Schoold, crystals, indigo and rainbow children, light conception and detailed information about the healing carried out on Jeshua (Jesus) following his crucifixion are all included. It is not written as a narrative, but as a series of past life sessions carried out with different people. The authors add their comments as appropriate. My expectation was that this would disrupt the flow of the information. This was not the case, and reading the accounts of past events in the words of those who experienced them enhanced their authenticity. Information was also channeled from an angelic being called Alariel, and here again the energy was powerful. I found this a fascinating book, and one I will surely refer to in the future. The Power of the Magdalene is a sequel to &#39;The Essenes - Children of the Light&#39; by the same authors, also based on the information from past life sessions. --Diana Savil of The Paradigm Shift</p><h2>Between Riverside and Crazy (TCG Edition)</h2><p><p>"Guirgis, like other storytellers who explore the sacred and profane, is most interested in how grace transforms us."&#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>Written with humor, tenderness, grit, and wonderment by acclaimed playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis, <i>Between Riverside and Crazy </i>is an extraordinary new play: a dark comedy about a man trying to maintain control as the world unravels around him.</p><p>City Hall is demanding more than his signature, the Landlord wants him out, the liquor store is closed, and the Church won't leave him alone.

I&#x2019;d locate it somewhere south of cozy and north of dangerous, west of sitcom and due east of tragedy.&#x201d; Ben Brantley, <i>New York Times</i><br><br> Guirgis has playwriting nerves of steel. For one thing, he chooses the right kind of worlds to write about: parallel to, but in many ways hidden from, our own, strange enough to fascinate yet recognizable enough to hit home. Language, too: the dialogue is always emotionally specific and accurate to the character, even as it makes the most profane and hilarious leaps... Completely compelling.&#x201d; Jesse Green, <i>New York</i><br><br> Scenes switch from tender to gritty to shocking... Guirgis specializes in stories of working-class heroes and zeroes and everyone in between.&#x201d; Joe Dziemianowicz, <i>NY Daily News</i><br><br> A wonderful, generous, altogether unpredictable urban tragicomedy.&#x201d; Linda Winer, <i>Newsday</i><br><br> Guirgis, like other storytellers who explore the sacred and the profane, is most interested in how grace transforms us. His empathetic, poetic tales of ex-cons, addicts, and other men whom society would label losers return us, again and again, to a world that Guirgis, by virtue of his particular religion the church of the streets illuminates with the bright and crooked light of his faith.&#x201d; Hilton Als, <i>New Yorker</i><br><br> A gem!

Jewish Studies. Women's Studies. WILD MILK is like Borscht Belt meets Leonora Carrington; it's like Donald Barthelme meets Pony Head; it's like the Brothers Grimm meet Beckett in his swim trunks at the beach. In other words, this remarkable collection of stories is unlike anything you've read.</p><p>Sabrina Orah Mark has received fellowships from the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, the Glenn Schaeffer Foundation, and The National Endowment for the Arts. She is the author of WILD MILK (Dorothy, a publishing project, 2018) as well as the poetry collections TSIM TSUM and THE BABIES, both from Saturnalia Books. Her poetry has appeared in many journals and in the anthologies, <em>Legitimate Dangers: American Poets of the New Century</em> and <em>The Best American Poetry 2007</em>."Mark's collection is perplexingly captivating; she applies a poet's playful sensibilities to the fiction form and creates something astonishing and new."--<strong><em>Publisher's Weekly</em></strong><br><br>"Dorothy, a publishing project, which is committed to 'works of fiction or near fiction or about fiction, mostly by women,' has, for nearly 10 years, proven an ally to genre-bending writing. Mark's book is on a par with the best work they've put out, such as Leonora Carrington's <em>The Complete Stories</em> and Jen George's <em>The Babysitter at Rest</em>."--<strong><em>The Millions</em></strong><br><br>"<em>Wild Milk</em> is equal parts setup and punchline, a brilliant logic of surreal, layered humor that skips its way towards deeply felt truths. Author Sabrina Orah Mark, who has previously written two books of poetry, offers us short stories that blend fairytale, Who's-on-First-style drollery, and current cultural moment to deliver back a clearer version of our own warped reality."--<strong><em>The Arkansas International</em></strong><br><br>"Sabrina Orah Mark is a writer of strangeness &amp; tenderness &amp; undeniable brilliance. I wanted to read this book aloud to everyone I've ever loved, &amp; to fold it into a locket to keep close to my heart."--<strong>Elizabeth McCracken</strong><br><br>"Essentially, this is a book about mothering. Existentially, this is a book about anxiety. Everything herein is a child--teeth, presidents, prayers, apricots, seahorses, jokes, snails...Calling these <em>stories</em> doesn't seem quite right--each comes alive in your hands, not like a child but like its cry."--<strong>Nick Flynn</strong><br><br>"The stories drift in the way of the best fairy tales--released from dependence on narrative sensibility to become both more odd and more true than any mere fiction...Stories in which laughter is sometimes the only response to sorrow, beauty is strange, and love is fierce and unending. A necessary book for our perilous age."--<strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em>, [starred review]</strong><br><br>"Totally spellbinding and mesmerizing."--<strong><em>Boston Globe</em></strong><br><br>"Maybe this is a collage of spells arranged by Andy Kaufman to conjure a strange forest into being, or a contemporary interpretation of Dada's joyous weirdness, or just a reincarnation of one of James Tate's later poem run amok. Whatever it is, <em>Wild Milk</em> is strange, unsettling, funny and brilliant collection that manages to be both profoundly weird and mundanely thoughtful at the same time."--<strong>Josh Cook, bookseller at Porter Square Books</strong><br><br>"Mark is obviously a talent in the vein of Leonora Carrington, maintaining the strange dreamlike atmosphere of her fiction without losing its sense of substance, using skillfully interwoven images that create tight seams between each story."--<strong><em>Paris Review Daily</em> staff pick</strong><br><br>"Presidents, professors, a lover called Poems, and a family parakeet called Bye Bye Francoise: these are only several of the many memorable characters we get to meet inside Sabrina Orah Mark's wondrous short story collection <em>Wild Milk</em>. These glorious, distilled, funny, and sometimes devastating stories engage with the past, our present, politics, trauma, terror, and love. At the same time, they offer a stunning and close-up portrait of an American family."--<strong>Will Walton, author and bookseller at Avid Bookshop [on Instagram]</strong></p><h2>Critique of Modern Youth Ministry (Canon Press Monographs)</h2><p>Today, everybody seems to be trying desperately to pander to young people in the church, even as growing numbers flee from it.

It even played a hidden role in the American conquest of California, the launch of the Republican Party, and the birth of John Steinbeck's first novel. Along the way, Lake Tahoe found the time to invent the ski industry, spark the sexual revolution, and win countless Academy Awards. <i>Tahoe beneath the Surface</i> brings this hidden history of America's largest mountain lake to life through the stories of its most celebrated residents and visitors over the last ten thousand years. It mixes local Washoe Indian legends with tales of murderous Mafia dons, and Rat Pack tunes with Steinbeck novels. It establishes Tahoe as one of America's literary hot spots by tracing the steps of more than a dozen authors including Bertrand Russell, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Michael Ondaatje. <i>Tahoe beneath the Surface</i> reveals how the lake transformed the lives of conservationists like John Muir, humorists like Mark Twain, and Hollywood icons like Frank Sinatra. It even touches upon some of the darker aspects of American history, including anti-Chinese racism and the Kennedy assassination.<p>Despite the impact Lake Tahoe has had on America, environmental threats loom large, and Tahoe Blue&#x2014;a term that Lankford uses to encompass the whole range of life, beauty, and meaning the lake represents&#x2014;grows increasingly vulnerable. In <i>Tahoe beneath the Surface</i>, human history and natural history combine in a most engaging way, one that will both inform and inspire all who would keep Tahoe blue.</p></p><p>Raised in Colorado, Scott Lankford got lost en route to Stanford University and spent much of the next ten years as a maintenance man, musician, and mountaineering guide at Lake Tahoe.

Currently a professor of English at Foothill College, in California&#39;s Silicon Valley, he has also served as Foothill&#39;s dean of Language Arts and codirector of the Foothill College Center for a Sustainable Future.''I urge readers to dive into this book headfirst and to allow its currents to carry them along.

(<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)</p><h2>The Complete Short Stories Of Thomas Wolfe</h2><p><i>The Complete Short Stories of Thomas Wolfe</i> stands as the most comprehensive edition of Thomas Wolfe&#x2019;s short fiction to date. Collected by Francis E. Skipp, these fifty-eight stories span the breadth of Thomas Wolfe&#x2019;s career, from the uninhibited young writer meticulously describing the enchanting birth of springtime in &#x201c;The Train and the City&#x201d; to his mature, sober account of a terrible lynching in &#x201c;The Child by Tiger.&#x201d; Thirty-five of these stories have never before been collected, and &#x201c;The Spanish Letter&#x201d; is published here for the first time. Vital, compassionate, remarkably attuned to character, scene, and social context, <i>The Complete Short Stories of Thomas Wolfe</i> represents the last work we have from the author of <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i>, who was considered the most promising writer of his generation (<i>The New York Times</i>).</p><p>Thomas Wolfe (1900&#x2013;1938) was born in Asheville, North Carolina, and educated at the University of North Carolina and Harvard University. He taught English at New York University and traveled extensively in Europe and America. Wolfe created his legacy as a classic American novelist with <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i>; <i>Of Time and the River</i>; <i>A Stone, a Leaf, a Door</i>; and <i>From Death to Morning</i>.Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of Wolfe's death and a suitable occasion for a retrospective. Of the 58 stories in this volume, 35 have never before been collected, and one, "The Spanish Letter," is published for the first time. Wolfe was not a short story writer; most of these fragments were plucked from his massive manuscripts, and many would be more appropriately classified as essay or memoir. "The Spanish Letter," relating the author's visits to Nazi Germany, strongly condemns the "poisoning" of German culture and society by Hitler and his followers. It's a fine piece, but elsewhere Wolfe's well-known faults are conspicuously displayed. Even one of the best known of these stories, "Only the Dead Know Brooklyn," now embarrasses with its inept attempt to reproduce a Brooklyn accent. The puerile "Portrait of a Literary Critic" and heavy-handed "Justice Is Blind" are equally disappointing. With all its flaws, this collection serves as a useful reminder of Wolfe's once-formidable presence and the wide influence he formerly exerted. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Journey to Self-Realization - Collected Talks and Essays.

After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Daya Mata, one of his earliest and closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 1955. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.Yogananda has become an image - a remarkable, deep, sweet, poetic, ecstatic man enraptured of cosmic life - who has changed the map of American religious life. --Robert Ellwood, Ph.

At first her family claimed she had been taken by fairies-but then her badly burned body was found in a shallow grave. Bridget&#39;s husband, father, aunt, and four cousins were arrested and tried for murder, creating one of the first mass media sensations in Ireland and England as people tried to make sense of what had happened. Meanwhile, Tory newspapers in Ireland and Britain seized on the scandal to discredit the cause of Home Rule, playing on lingering fears of a savage Irish peasantry. Combining historical detective work, acute social analysis, and meticulous original scholarship, Angela Bourke investigates Bridget&#39;s murder.</p><p>In March 1895, Bridget Cleary became ill. Her husband, Michael, and a number of neighbors and relatives became convinced that she was a fairy changeling and tortured her to death. This grisly true story forms the basis of Angela Bourke's outstanding narrative <i>The Burning of Bridget Cleary</i>, in which the whole context of this "crime" and its punishment is sparely and powerfully laid out. Bourke's style, judgment, and eye for detail are superb. There are scenes in this book of appalling vividness--in particular, the chapters concerned with poor Bridget's end. The closed room, the men yelling questions at her, trying to force her to eat herbs boiled in milk (if she could eat them, then she might be the real Bridget and not the changeling), manhandling her; "lifting her body and winding it backwards and forwards, yelling, 'away with you; come home, Bridget, in the name of God!' while slapping her." On March 14, they held her over the fire to drive the spirits out, and on March 15, Bridget's husband set fire to her nightgown, throwing lamp oil on her to make the fire burn more fiercely. "She's not my wife," he told the assembled people. "You'll soon see her go up the chimney."<p> This is a chilling story, one that stays with you, creepily, long after you have finished reading. Like Arthur Miller's <i>The Crucible</i>, it seems to open itself to a wide variety of interpretation, and Bourke's balancing of old-world superstitious Ireland against the new rational nation about to be born is expert. These events may be a hundred years old, but they come over as frighteningly contemporary. <i>--Adam Roberts, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Angela Bourke is senior lecturer in Irish at University College, Dublin.

Sevilla finds comic gems in court transcripts&#x2015;and now brings readers a delightful, all-new collection. Starting with a chapter on the defendants (one of whom, when asked his marital status, replies after a long pause, "Adequate") and following with sections on lawyers, experts, witnesses, evidence, and even one called "Malaprops" (DA: The status of the boat has no relevance to this case at all. This is a total fishing expedition). Stories from Sevilla's previous books have become viral Internet sensations, priming readers for more legal disorder, such as:</p><p>Clerk: Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to given in the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p><p>Witness: Yes, I swear. I&#x2019;ll say anything but the truth, nothing but the truth.</p> 14 illustrations</p><p>Perennially on the &#x201c;Best Lawyers in America&#x201d; list, Charles M. Sevilla has a private law practice in San Diego. He is the author of Wilkes on Trial and Wilkes: His Life and Crimes and a columnist for Forum.Here&#x2019;s Sevilla&#x2019;s third collection of funnies (Disorderly Conduct, 1989; Disorder in the Court, 1993) from U.S. courts, supplied by contributors, named and anonymous, from around the U.S. In 10 chapters, with such titles as &#x201c;The Defendants,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Lawyers,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Jurors,&#x201d; odd and humorous excerpts from court proceedings, sometimes in Q&amp;A format, are presented. Bad language, misunderstandings, and malapropisms abound, and sometimes the judges themselves let loose with fed-up lectures, comments, and last-word asides. The accused, for the most part, come up with the most comments, both unexpected and profane. Although some anecdotes may ring bigger bells for those in the legal field, others are easy to laugh at, even while noting that they&#x2019;re about probable serious offenders and others in nerve-racking spots (e.g., a forensic psychologist is asked his current position. Answer? &#x201c;Sitting&#x201d;). Sevilla opens each chapter with quotes from luminaries, ranging from Rodney Dangerfield to Charles Dickens to Albert Einstein, that provide food for thought amid the chuckles. Funny and eye-opening. --Eloise Kinney</p><h2>Purgatorio: A New Verse Translation</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Were Merwin not one of America&#x2019;s most admired poets, he would still be as famous as translators get.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly </em>(starred review)</p><p>&#x201c;In the foreword to his new translation [of Purgatorio], Merwin . . . writes feelingly of his 30-year obsession with the poem. And indeed, the flaws as well as the virtues of his new rendering may be said to stem from a profound reverence for the original.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>The New York Times</em></p><p>W.S. Merwin&#x2019;s rendition of the <em>Purgatorio</em> is considered a pinnacle and highlight from a prolific and celebrated career in poetry and translation. The most neglected and arguably the most rewarding book of Dante&#x2019;s Divine Comedy, <em>Purgatorio</em> finds Dante undertaking the arduous journey of scaling the terraces of Mount Purgatory. Presented in a bilingual edition with the translator&#x2019;s notes and commentary, Merwin&#x2019;s interpretation of Dante&#x2019;s great poem of sin, repentance, and salvation is a profoundly moving work of art and a luminous translation for our time. When asked why he translated this book, as opposed to the <em>Inferno</em> or <em>Paradiso</em>, Merwin responded, &#x201c;The <em>Purgatorio</em> is more like life.&#x201d;</p><p><strong>From &#x201c;Canto XXII&#x201d;:</strong></p><p><em>And I went on, lighter than I had been<br>at the other passageways, so that without<br>effort I climbed after the swift spirits,<br>when Virgil began, &#x201c;Love that is set alight<br>by virtue always sets alight another<br>if only its flame can be seen shining out</em></p><p><strong>W.S. Merwin </strong>is one of America&#x2019;s greatest poets and translators. He won the Pulitzer Prize twice, most recently for The Shadow of Sirius. He lives in Hawaii, where the Governor declared Merwin&#x2019;s birthday&#x2015;September 30&#x2015;&#x201d;W.S. Merwin Day.&#x201d;</p></p><p>W. S. Merwin has authored dozens of books of poetry, prose, and works in translation. A beloved voice in American literature with steadfast commitments to environmentalist and anti-imperialist causes, Merwin is a former U.S. Poet Laureate and two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for The Carrier of Ladders (1971) and The Shadow of Sirius (2009). His most recent volume is Garden Time (2016). Merwin has lived in Hawaii since 1976, where he and his wife restored the barren land of a former pineapple plantation into a haven for endangered palm species. In 2010, The Merwin Conservancy was founded to preserve Merwin&#x2019;s literary legacy, home, and palm forest and to serve as a retreat and study for the arts, environmental advocacy, and community education. Merwin has been recognized and awarded numerous prizes throughout his career, including fellowships from the Academy of American Poets, Guggenheim Foundation, and National Endowment for the Arts.<p>Canto XXII<br><br>By this time the angel was behind us,<br>the angel who had turned us toward the sixth<br>circle, erasing one stroke from my face,<br><br>and had told us that they are bless�d whose<br>thirst is for justice, and he confined his<br>words to &#x201c;thirst,&#x201d; without the rest of the text.<br><br>And I went on, lighter than I had been<br>at the other passageways, so that without<br>effort I climbed after the swift spirits,<br><br>when Virgil began, &#x201c;Love that is set alight<br>by virtue always sets alight another<br>if only its flame can be seen shining out,<br><br>so, since the hour when Juvenal came down<br>among us, into the limbo of Hell,<br>and brought me tidings of your affection,<br><br>my good will toward you has been as great<br>as one can feel for a person never seen,<br>so that now this stairway will seem short.<br><br>But tell me, and as a friend forgive me<br>if excess of confidence prompts me<br>to loosen the rein, and speak now as a friend to me:<br><br>how could avarice ever have found a place<br>within your breast, taken up as it was<br>with all that wisdom your own zeal had put there?&#x201d;<br><br>These words at first led Statius to smile<br>a little, and then he answered, &#x201c;All<br>you say is a dear token of love,<br><br>but in truth, things have a way of appearing, often,<br>that provides misleading grounds for doubt<br>because the real cause of them is hidden.<br><br>Your question shows me that you believe<br>I was avaricious in the other life,<br>no doubt because of that circle where I was.<br><br>Now you should know that avarice was too far<br>away from me, and this lack of measure<br>thousands of moons have been punishment for.<br><br>And if I had not righted my concerns<br>when I had understood the passage where<br>you cry out, as though enraged at human nature,<br><br>&#x2018;To what, oh accurs�d hunger for gold,<br>do you not drive the appetite of mortals?&#x2019;<br>I would feel the jousts down where the weights are rolled.<br><br>Then I learned that our hands can spread their wings<br>too wide in spending, and I repented<br>of that as of my other wrongdoings.<br><br>How many will rise without most of their hair<br>through ignorance, that takes away repentance<br>of this sin through life and at the last hour!<br><br>And you should know that the counterfault,<br>in exact opposition to every sin,<br>here withers, along with it, from its green,<br><br>so that if for my cleansing I have stayed<br>among those people who lament avarice,<br>that happened to me because of its opposite.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now, when you sang about the cruel weapons<br>and of the twofold sorrow of Jocasta,&#x201d;<br>said the singer of the bucolic songs,<br><br>&#x201c;it does not seem, from the notes Clio touches<br>with you there, that you were yet made faithful<br>by the faith without which good works alone fail.<br><br>If that is so, what sun or candles lighted<br>the darkness for you so that from then on<br>you set your sails to follow the fisherman?&#x201d;<br><br>And the other to him, &#x201c;You first showed me the way<br>to Parnassus to drink from its grottoes,<br>and it was you, after God, who first enlightened me.<br><br>You did what someone does walking at night<br>holding the lantern behind him so that<br>it does him no good but makes wise those who follow<br><br>when you said, &#x2018;The age is growing new again.<br>Justice returns, and the first human time,<br>and a new progeny descends from Heaven.&#x2019;<br><br>Because of you I was a poet, because of you<br>a Christian, but to show you better<br>what I am drawing, I will reach out to color it.<br><br>The whole world was already pregnant<br>with the true faith, which had been sown<br>by the messengers from the eternal kingdom<br><br>and those words of yours that I have just quoted<br>harmonized so well with the new preachers<br>that my visits to them became a habit.<br><br>In time they came to seem so holy that<br>when Domitian persecuted them<br>they never wept without my own tears falling,<br><br>and for the rest of the time that I was there<br>I helped them, and their upright behavior<br>led me to hold all the other sects in scorn.<br><br>And before I had brought the Greeks to the rivers<br>of Thebes, in my poem, I had been<br>baptized, but fear kept me a secret Christian,<br><br>pretending for a long time to be a pagan,<br>and this tepidness kept me circling<br>on the fourth circle more than four centuries.<br><br>You then, who had raised the cover hiding<br>from me that great good of which I am speaking,<br>now on the way up, while we have time,<br><br>tell me, where is our ancient Terence, if<br>you know, and Caecilius, and Plautus and Varius?<br>Are they damned?

That doesn't mean these stories offer happy endings or simple answers. If there's one theme that unites them, it's the characters' desire to escape: from that haunted house...the restrictions of expected fictional tropes...racism and classism...misogyny and the associated bonds of social convention...and of course, foolish and dangerous preconceptions about the world that everyone holds in some measure (that's just about every story).

Our great-grandparents may have hand-pumped a well, and their ancestors lugged buckets of water from the river. But we&#x2019;re so accustomed to the convenience and availability of fresh water that we design our homes and grade our property to shed water and then pay to pipe it back in and spray it across our yards when rainfall is scarce&#x2014;and often even when it isn&#x2019;t. With a heedlessness born of cheap, plentiful water&#x2014;a supply many regions can no longer count on&#x2014;we run our sprinklers automatically and excessively, carpet our yards with thirsty lawn without regard to climate, and let rainwater and irrigation run off our yards and driveways into the street. This is madness. We must stop treating water as a disposable commodity in our landscapes and gardens and conserve it like the precious, limited resource it is.<br><br> The specter of drought, which has always haunted the American West, Great Plains, and Southwest, has lately spurred widespread interest in removing water-hogging lawns and an acceptance of drier gardens and native plants. Even in the wetter parts of the country, particularly the mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Midwest, water conservation is increasingly popular. Combined with a renewed national interest in living more sustainably with less waste of our natural resources, water conservation&#x2014;and, more broadly, water management&#x2014;is now a priority no matter where one lives.<br><br> This is not to say we must not water our gardens, and it&#x2019;s certainly not to say&nbsp;we must not <i>have</i> a garden. Planting a garden is a way of connecting with the natural rhythms of the seasons and with the earth itself. It&#x2019;s a deeply worthy endeavor that brings beauty into our lives and communities, offers islands of wildlife habitat amid acres of paved urban sprawl, and teaches us the slower virtues of patience and hope in a fast-paced, need-it-yesterday world. A garden is an expression of creativity, and the finest gardens are works of art that excite, delight, or move us. Gardens feed our bodies and our spirits. They soothe us when we&#x2019;re sick or sick at heart. Some can even accomplish that most miraculous feat of all: enticing our increasingly housebound children away from their computers and smartphones to trail their fingers in a pond, follow a butterfly&#x2019;s fluttering path, or explore a mysterious, winding path.<br><br> All gardens&#x2014;except those consisting only of rocks&#x2014;need water to live. Even cacti cannot live without water. So how do we reconcile our wish to conserve&#x2014;or, for those of us in drought-plagued regions, our pressing <i>need</i> to conserve&#x2014;this most essential resource with our desire for a garden, and more than that, for a beautiful garden?<br><br> We do it by changing the way we garden and by shifting our ideas of what a garden can be and should look like. Just as we&#x2019;ve learned to reduce water use indoors by turning off the faucet while we brush our teeth, installing low-flow toilets and showerheads, and waiting until the dishwasher is full before running a load, we can take similar water-saving measures in our gardens. These include choosing plants well adapted to our climate, irrigating less often and more efficiently, and using water-permeable paving. In addition, we can design gardens that actively collect rainwater and eliminate wasteful runoff. We can even use artistic arrangements of rock and&nbsp;plants to satisfy our &#x201c;sweet tooth&#x201d; for water by evoking the idea of it. Now that&#x2019;s getting creative!<br><br> This book will show you that a water-saving garden can be so much more than just cacti or succulents, although certainly those can be beautiful too. A garden that sips instead of guzzles can be quite lush if planted with regionally appropriate plants. It&#x2019;s a matter of adjusting expectations of what a&nbsp;garden <i>should</i> be and creating a responsible garden in harmony with nature. It&#x2019;s about accepting the reality of one&#x2019;s climate and gardening accordingly. If you live in a dry-summer climate, acknowledge that your garden will not be as flowery then as in wetter seasons and forgo the thirsty bedding annuals or perennials. If your region is arid, replace the lawn (or at least most of it) with native plants that thrive on rainfall, with occasional irrigation to get through excessively dry periods. It&#x2019;s a commonsense approach with far-reaching impact and the added long-term benefits of saving you money and effort.<br><br> All it takes is a willingness to garden in tune with local conditions. This may take some experimentation as climate change alters our traditional weather patterns, causing more extreme weather events including flooding and drought, deep freezes and heat waves. But the payoff is a garden that adds value to your life and your community without the burden of guilt about water waste, a garden that is more likely to survive if water shortages mandate watering restrictions, and a garden that gives more than it takes.<br><br> We&#x2019;ll start in Part One by touring several inspiring water-saving gardens to see what&#x2019;s working, with particular attention to design ideas you can apply to your own yard.<br><br> In Part Two you&#x2019;ll get practical, DIY-friendly techniques for holding on to rainwater through grading of soil, rain barrels, rain gardens, and water-permeable paving. We&#x2019;ll discuss irrigation, how to decide whether it&#x2019;s needed, and how to water efficiently, and you&#x2019;ll get the dirt on improving your soil&#x2019;s ability to hold water. Shade structures and windbreaks can also make a difference in preserving soil moisture, so we&#x2019;ll explore various <br> ways of blocking sun and wind.<br><br> Part Three is all about plants. We&#x2019;ll look at alternatives to the ubiquitous, thirsty lawn; how to group plants by watering needs, using native and adapted plants; and the best time of year to plant. Balcony and patio gardeners will appreciate a chapter devoted to saving water in container gardens.<br><br> In Part Four we&#x2019;ll explore creative ways of adding the illusion of watery abundance in a garden. From dry creeks to stream-like mosaics to contemporary, colored-glass &#x201c;rivers,&#x201d; squeezing water from stone has never been so fun. Like stone, certain plants evoke the idea of water through a cascading or spraying form. In addition, ancient dry-garden traditions like Japanese Zen gardens and Moorish gardens have much to teach us about gardening with less water, and we&#x2019;ll see what can be reinterpreted for today&#x2019;s gardens.<br><br> Part Five gets you started with a list of 101 plants with drought tolerance for gardens across the country. You&#x2019;ll find a variety of trees, shrubs, perennials, groundcovers, and more, with brief descriptions and growing information to help you make the right choices for your climate and your garden&#x2019;s specific conditions.</p><h2>Justice League Vol, 2</h2><p><b>With the godlike maniac called the Batman Who Laughs as a secret weapon, criminal mastermind Lex Luthor continues to assemble his Legion of Doom, pulling in Wonder Woman's and Aquaman's archenemies Cheetah and Black Manta.</b><br><br>But an even deeper and deadlier threat is on the way.

Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The Red Badge of Courage was published in 1895, when its author, an impoverished writer living a bohemian life in New York, was only twenty-three. It immediately became a bestseller, and Stephen Crane became famous. Crane set out to create "a psychological portrayal of fear." Henry Fleming, a Union Army volunteer in the Civil War, thinks "that perhaps in a battle he might run....As far as war was concerned he knew nothing of himself." And he does run in his first battle, full of fear and then remorse. He encounters a grotesquely rotting corpse propped against a tree, and a column of wounded men, one of whom is a friend who dies horribly in front of him. Fleming receives his own "red badge" when a fellow soldier hits him in the head with a gun.

Why doesn't he clean it up, and weed his garden and sweep his walk? Henry's got better things to do. Tired of being bothered, he finally gets fed up and moves away. The funny thing is, nobody's really happy when he does--not the neighbors, and not Henry. Here is a wise and witty tale about different kinds of people learning to get along.<p></p></p><p><p>Stephen Gammell is the illustrator of <em>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</em>, <em>More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</em>, and <em>Scary Stories 3</em>, as well as many other books. He won the Caldecott Medal for <em>Song and Dance Man</em> by Karen Ackerman. He also earned Caldecott Honors for <em>Where the Buffaloes Begin</em> by Olaf Baker and <em>The Relatives Came</em> by Cynthia Rylant.</p>Grade 1-3Old Henry , told in verse, relates the interactions of a stubborn individualist and his neighbors in a small town. When Henry moves in to a dilapidated old house, his new neighbors look forward to his fixing it up. When he is content to leave it as it is, his neighbors become upset. The mayor suggests that they try being nice, ``please, try it twice.'' But their efforts are rebuffed. Eventually Henry leaves. While the neighbors begin to question their actions, Henry also realizes he misses them. The story ends with his letter to the mayor seeking a compromise, and younger children may have problems with the lack of closure to the story. Yet the book raises interesting questions about individual freedom versus community responsibility and would be useful for a discussion of these ideas at home or school. Gammell's softly colored pencil drawings give Henry more character than is brought out in the text, with his jaunty railroad cap and mismatched socks. There are no solid blocks of color to be found here. Every surface glows with a prism of hues, as though to emphasize the many facets to be found in both Henry and his neighbors and the world they share.

Chiles, is an unusual book: it appeals to the macabre desires that keep us riveted to highway accidents, while knowledgeably discoursing on the often preventable mistakes that caused them. At its heart are colorful stories behind more than 50 of the most infamous catastrophes that periodically chilled the advance of the industrial age. There are both those well remembered (the 1986 Challenger explosion, for example) and those now largely forgotten (a 1937 gas explosion at a Texas school that killed 298). But along with lively depictions of these deadly devastations and white-knuckle calamities--the U.S. battleship Maine, Apollo 13, and Three Mile Island among them--Chiles offers an informed analysis of the unfortunate chain of events that brought them about. And by grouping like incidents to show how fatal "system fractures" eventually developed through a combination of human error and mechanical malfunction, he also suggests how we might sidestep such tragedies in the future. In so, doing he fashions these spectacular accounts of failed planes, trains, ships, bridges, dams, factories, and other conveyances and facilities into a cautionary tale about technological progress. --<i>Howard Rothman</i><p>James R.

After years of feeling depressed, anxious, and hopeless, in a life that seemed to have no escape, she healed her own heart by caring for others. She has learned to fiercely listen despite being nearly deaf, to banish shame attached to a body mass index, and to rebuild a family after the debilitating&nbsp;loss of her father when she was eight.

A feeling my mother once had, her grandmother Rose holding her in her lap, before Rose had the breast cancer, before it ravaged her body, before her broad shoulders began to slump with the weight of defeat and dying and the wrenching chemotherapy.<br><br>Before I was a memory, I was my mother's little head being cradled into her grandmother's chest, after she'd been released from the hospital, after she had run, in her five-year-old body, out into a rural New Jersey road and a car ran over her tiny head.<br><br>Rose lived with my mother�s family at the time. Bubbe Rose was the only one who ever showed my mother any kind of affection or attention, besides my mother�s own sister, Ellen. Her mother, my maternal grandmother, Marion, saved money by never turning on the lights. She kept plastic on the sofa for protection. Cockroaches scurried over the dirty floor. She sat in the dark for hours on end.<br><br>My mother, at five years old, wanting to die, ran out right in front of a car and that car drove over her.<br><br>My mother floated over the houses and imagined landing in one that welcomed her with, Hello! I am so happy you are here. I am so happy you are alive. I love you. There you are. We got you. We've been waiting for you.<br><br>Isn't it incomprehensible what the imagination is capable of? How deeply we want affection and love? How we are, even at five years old, willing to risk our lives to find it?<br><br>There is a scar above my mother's right eye, barely visible. I remember how my mother would always say, When your time is up, it is up, don't be afraid. Her time was not up, it would seem, by her reasoning. Bubbe Rose pulling her into her bosom, Shh, Bubbelah, I love you, it's going to be okay, and my mother closed her eyes and saw only her own mother saying, I wish you were never born.<br><br>My mother took her grandmother's love and placed it somewhere inside of her next to the darkness of being unwanted and unloved and I grew from that. An idea as inconceivable as being run over by a two-ton vehicle and surviving with only a tiny scar that has to be pointed out to be noticed at all.<br><br>When my mother's grandmother Rose got to the end, my mother held her hand and whispered, Shh, shhh, it's going to be all right, reaching inside of herself and away from the darkness to that memory of safety and love, and there she found the idea. The idea was this: I can give this away, this love, I do not have to keep it here in the dark, I can give it away and create more, even if I don't remember what it feels like to be loved. I can create it.<br><br>All the stories that live inside of me, that I am holding, both sustain and haunt me. The time when my mother was eighteen and had started working in Center City in Philly, at Rohm and Haas, a chemical manufacturer, where she worked in foreign operations marketing and airfreight. She'd bought all new clothes for the job, and came home once to find that her mother had taken a scissors and sliced through all of them in her closet. She sat and wept into half of a skirt, a sleeve, a pant leg, and yet, still, on every Mother's Day, she sent flowers; she tried so hard to reach inside of herself and find a memory besides that of her grandmother Rose that said I love you, and when she could not find any, she begged her mother to love her, until she died all those years later when my mother was sixty-three years old. Please love me, please love me, please love me and my grandmother sealed her ears to those pleas and sat on her plastic-covered sofa in the dark and did crossword puzzles and complained about the weather.<br><br>Before I was born, I was just a memory of love, and thank the gods of coffee and books for that memory, because if my mother did not have her grandmother Rose, if she was left to the machinations of her own mother, she would be forever stuck in that South Philly row house. My grandmother was endlessly picking up men at the nightclub where she was the hatcheck girl. They were dangerous and mean. Sometimes my mother sat in a damp basement with the neighbor my grandmother left her with when she went on dates. I can imagine men pulling my mother to them, her small body a separate planet entirely. How could she have stayed in her body and endured?<br><br>Luckily my mother had the memory somewhere inside that body she so often left, a memory of the love she had felt from her grandmother. Before we are molecules, we are memory. Every time my grandmother winced as she looked at my mother, every time she tried to unspeak her into not existing, that's in me.<br><br>My mother grew up in a brick row house in South Philadelphia on Reese Street. Her mother's parents, whom she called Bubbe (Rose) and Zayda (Al), also lived with them. They both died before I was born. It was a dark, narrow space that always smelled like cat pee when I would visit as a child. I rummaged in my grandparents' basement for Barbie doll clothes my great-grandmother Helen, my grandfather's mother, had sewn. My mother's stories have been in me as long as I can remember. Both my mom and my dad treated me like an adult since the time I could talk, so the tales of my grandmother Marion have no origin story for me. I have always known: she was a monster. I remember asking my mom, Why didn't Grandmom ever say she loved us? Did she hate my sister and me? Why does she sit in the dark all the time? Why is she so mean?<br><br>My grandmother got pregnant with my mom when she was eighteen years old. My grandfather had been a sailor stationed at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and was only home once a year until the time my mom and her sister, Ellen, were teenagers. When I started asking serious questions about why my grandmother was so unkind, it was as if my mother became uncorked and all the years of abuse and neglect and sheer terribleness flowed out of her and into the air. She told me everything.<br><br>It was 1983 and I was reading Judy Blume's Forever. I was eight years old and my father was still alive and I thought how lucky he was that he had my Bubbe, who was so loving and gentle and grandmotherly, and how unfair it was that my mom had grown up with her monster of a mother. That was my first true moment of realizing that there is no such thing as fair. I decided then that fair was a made-up word that might as well be in the fairy tale I was reading except I was not reading fairy tales, I was reading about sex and penises named Ralph and any other adult book I could get my grubby paws on.<br><br>Marion, my grandmother, worked as a hatcheck girl at Big Bill's, a nightclub in Center City, Philadelphia. She slept every day until three p.m. and they all dreaded the hours from three p.m. until seven thirty, when she finally left for work. Once she left for work it was calm again, my mother told me. My grandmother had dates with all those men while my grandfather was away in the navy. My mom said that neither she nor her sister Ellen ever got birthday presents except for when one of the very temporary boyfriends would take them to Lord &amp; Taylor on the Main Line in Philadelphia to pick one out. She said, "She would brag about giving me the present, but it never came from her. It was always from the boyfriends." Clothes from shops along the Main Line, before there were shopping malls. A smoky topaz heart on a gold chain my mother wore all her life. And once, a cocker spaniel named Sandy, whom my grandmother later abandoned in the street.<br><br>My mother told me these stories while I sat at our kitchen dinette set in Pennsauken with the yellow vinyl cushions, the backs of my thighs stuck to them, making that noise they make when they peel off, like suction cups, and I watched my mom put flounder in the oven as I wrote stories. I let one leg at a time stick to the vinyl and then pulled it off like a vacuum, thinking it was hilarious because it was something my dad liked to do.<br><br>My father had a high-pitched laugh, like a sheep. He'd bray after he asked, "Who did that? Was it you, Jennifer? Rachel?" and then there was laughter and silence and we ate spaghetti and crab, stuffed pork chops, meatballs and gravy, or whatever my mom had made that day. My father never cooked. Never even poured his own cereal, or so the story goes. I recall only my mom doing anything remotely domesticated, like cleaning or cooking, grocery shopping, and making her own salad dressings. My dad's job was to go to work in a men's clothing store, make us laugh, buy us presents, and sing "You Are My Sunshine" to us before bed. Other than that, my mom did it all. Even simple tasks like driving my sister and me to school: my dad often got lost on the three-mile drive.<br><br>There were dishes in the sink, patterned plates, long foggy glasses with my father's lip marks. The island in the center of the kitchen had not been built yet. That came after my father died, when my mother used most of his life-insurance money to remodel the kitchen right before we left the house forever.<br><br>My mom talked as she made dinner or cleaned the kitchen counter with Clorox. She told me so many stories as if no one had ever listened to her in her entire life, which I came to realize they hadn't. I was the first, and I had to work hard to hear her above my constant tinnitus that I didn't understand or tell anyone about. I assumed this was what everyone heard, how sound existed in everyone's head.<br><br>I was fascinated with understanding why we had to go visit my grandmother Marion, why my mother still sent her presents, why my mom didn't hate her. I wanted to know why why why and how how how as I peeled my sweaty summer leg off the kitchen chair and stuck it back on, again and again, until my mom asked me to stop because the sound was driving her crazy. It felt like an impossible math equation to me and I was awful at math. If my mom had such an odious childhood and such an awful mom, why did we have a relationship with her? It did not make sense.<br><br>"That's just the way I am. I forgive," my mother said as she unloaded groceries and put them away; Pepsi for my dad and his Breyers chocolate ice cream. Those are always the groceries of my memories. Coffee, Kools, Breyers.<br><br>I never wanted to forgive my grandmother. My mom had told me too many things, things I perhaps already knew, things that lived so far in the marrow of me that I did not even need to hear them spoken aloud in kitchens, yet when I did, I wanted to throw things at walls, and at my mother. I thought about how my mom had been run over by a car when she was five years old. A story I had heard so many times that I wondered if I made it up in my unicorn diary because it felt like it was mine and had always been mine. I touched my eye to see if I had a scar there and sometimes it felt like I did. A tiny ridge under my eyebrow hairs.<br><br>My mom said that she had no memory of the faces from the day she was hit, so I made the faces up. She had been on a car ride to New Jersey from Philadelphia with my grandmother and one of the faceless, sometimes kind, sometimes not so kind boyfriends. In my mind, he had big hairy hands and brown eyes with eyelashes that pointed straight down. He smelled like cigarettes. My mom had been hit in the head and thrown thirty feet.<br><br>"I can't believe I survived and that they saved my eyes," she said every time she talked about it, lifting her thick brown bangs to show me the scar. I touched my own eye and said, "You can barely see it."<br><br>"I know," she always said, "but it's there."<br><br>We all had thick brown bangs since forever. I was probably born with bangs. It wasn't until I was a teenager that I realized I even had eyebrows. Bangs equal the eighties in my mind.<br><br>She had been trying to run away from her mother and the boyfriend while my grandfather was away overseas in the navy. She ran from them and right into the front of a car speeding on a small rural Jersey road. The car handle went through her right eye.<br><br>I was curious about my great-grandmother Rose. In my mom's stories, she was always kind and loving, and yet her daughter, my grandmother, was vicious and mean. I thought we were simply extensions of our parents. Whoever they were, we were. Or more precisely, would inevitably, and inextricably, become. I wanted to know my mother's Bubbe Rose so I could understand that love was not necessarily inherited, but that it could be created, fashioned from all sorts of things, including pain and car handles going through eyes.<br><br>"Tell me about your Bubbe Rose," I said as my mom sat down with her tea. Daddy drank coffee and Mommy had tea. I would come to hate tea.<br><br>"My Bubbe got breast cancer when I was fourteen years old. She was fifty-four. I was in ninth grade and they called me into the office to tell me my grandmother had cancer. I didn't even know what cancer was."<br><br>Rose begged my mother to give her a whole bottle of pain pills every day. Every day for seven months she asked to be put out of her misery.<br><br>"When I look back now, I wish I had given them to her. She suffered so much. The day she died, they called an ambulance, but she wouldn't get into it unless I was with her. I was at the park with my friends but a neighbor came to find me and we went to the hospital in the ambulance. She died in the emergency room. She was completely yellow and she was lying with her mouth open. I was fourteen."</p><h2>1919 The Year That Changed America</h2><p><p><b>WINNER OF THE 2019 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD</b></p><p>1919 was a world-shaking year. America was recovering from World War I and black soldiers returned to racism so violent that that summer would become known as the Red Summer. The suffrage movement had a long-fought win when women gained the right to vote. Laborers took to the streets to protest working conditions; nationalistic fervor led to a communism scare; and temperance gained such traction that prohibition went into effect. Each of these movements reached a tipping point that year. </p><p>Now, one hundred years later, these same social issues are more relevant than ever.

Even a rough estimate is impossible. Hawaiians named taro patches, rocks, trees, canoe landings, resting places in the forests, and the tiniest spots where miraculous events are believed to have taken place. And place names are far from static--names are constantly being given to new houses and buildings, streets and towns, and old names are replaced by new ones.</p><p>It is essential, then, to record the names and the lore associated with them now, while Hawaiians are here to lend us their knowledge. And, whatever the fate of the Hawaiian language, the place names will endure. The first edition of <i>Place Names of Hawaii</i> contained only 1,125 entries.

There is, however, a question as to whether, prior to a few centuries ago, such entities would have been regarded as properly supernatural; for a given creature or event to be regarded as supernatural, one must have a clearly defined conception of the natural, from which the supernatural can be regarded as an aberration or departure. In Western culture, the parameters of the natural have been increasingly delimited by science, and it is therefore not surprising that the supernatural, as a distinct literary genre, first emerged in the eighteenth century, when scientific advance had reached a stage where certain phenomena could be recognized as manifestly beyond the bounds of the natural. H. P. Lovecraft, one of the leading theoreticians of the genre as well as one of its pioneering practitioners, emphasized this point somewhat flamboyantly in his essay &#x201c;Supernatural Horror in Literature&#x201d; (1927):<br> &nbsp;<br> The true weird tale has something more than secret murder, bloody bones, or a sheeted form clanking chains according to rule. A certain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread of outer, unknown forces must be present; and there must be a hint, expressed with a seriousness and portentousness becoming its subject, of that most terrible conception of the human brain&#x2014;a malign and particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of un-plumbed space.<br> &nbsp;<br> What this means is that the supernatural tale, while adhering to the strictest canons of mimetic realism, must have its emotional and aesthetic focus upon the chosen avenue of departure from the natural&#x2014;whether it be a creature such as the vampire, the ghost, or the werewolf, or a series of events such as might occur in a haunted house. If all the events of a tale are set in an imaginary realm, then we have crossed over into fantasy, because the contrast between the natural and the supernatural does not come into play. Conversely, the supernatural tale must be clearly distinguished from the tale of psychological horror, where the horror is generated by witnessing the aberrations of a diseased mind. Lovecraft, in discussing William Faulkner&#x2019;s tale of necrophilia, &#x201c;A Rose for Emily&#x201d; (1930), made clear this distinction, also pointing out the degree to which the supernatural tale is tied to developments in the sciences:<br> &nbsp;<br> Manifestly, this is a dark and horrible thing which could happen, whereas the crux of a weird tale is something which could not possibly happen. If any unexpected advance of physics, chemistry, or biology were to indicate the possibility of any phenomena related by the weird tale, that particular set of phenomena would cease to be weird in the ultimate sense because it would become surrounded by a different set of emotions. It would no longer represent imaginative liberation, because it would no longer indicate a suspension or violation of the natural laws against whose universal dominance our fancies rebel. (Letter to August Derleth, November 20, 1931)<br> &nbsp;<br> Given the fact that the commencement of supernatural literature in the West is canonically dated to the publication of Horace Walpole&#x2019;s The Castle of Otranto (1764), there is no intrinsic reason why Americans need feel any inferiority to Europe in regard to their contributions to the form; for it was just at this time that American literature was itself beginning to declare its own aesthetic independence from that of Great Britain. And yet, less than half a century after the United States became a distinct geopolitical entity, British critic William Hazlitt threw down the following gauntlet: &#x201c;No ghost, we will venture to say, was ever seen in North America. They do not walk in broad day; and the night of ignorance and superstition which favours their appearance, was long past before the United States lifted up their head beyond the Atlantic wave&#x201d; (Edinburgh Review, October 1829). Hazlitt may have been seeking merely to emphasize the new nation&#x2019;s continued cultural inferiority to the land that gave it birth, and he may also have been guilty of exaggerating the rationality that governed the founding of the American colonies, but in spite of all caveats he does appear to raise a valid point. Since so much of supernatural fiction appears to find the source of its terrors in the depths of the remote past, how can a nation that does not have much of a past express the supernatural in literature? The Gothic novels of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were predicated on horrors emerging from the &#x201c;ignorance and superstition&#x201d; of the British or European Dark Ages, but if a country did not experience the Dark Ages, how could those horrors be depicted plausibly? The authors represented in this volume, covering nearly the entirety of American history, sought to answer these questions in a multiplicity of ways, and their varying solutions shed considerable light on the development of the supernatural tale as an art form.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although there is considerable evidence that the British Gothic novel was voraciously read in the United States, few Americans attempted their hand at it: the sole exponent of the form was Charles Brockden Brown (1771&#x2013;1810), who chose to follow the model of Ann Radcliffe in making use of what has been termed the &#x201c;explained supernatural,&#x201d; where the supernatural is suggested at the outset but ultimately explained away as the product of misconstrual or trickery. As a result, Brockden Brown does not qualify as America&#x2019;s first supernaturalist, and that distinction remains with the unlikely figure of Washington Irving: unlikely because his writing as a whole&#x2014;lighthearted, urbane, comic, even at times self-parodic&#x2014;would seem as far removed from the flamboyant luridness of Matthew Gregory Lewis or the guilt-ridden intensity of Charles Robert Maturin as anything could possibly be. And yet, the supernatural comprised a persistent thread in Irving&#x2019;s work, notably in his two story collections, The Sketch Book (1820) and Tales of a Traveller (1824). That Irving was able to find inspiration in the Dutch legendry of New York and New England&#x2014;a legendry already two centuries old by the time he began writing&#x2014;suggests that even a &#x201c;new&#x201d; land (new, of course, only in terms of European settlement) could quickly gain a fund of superstition that had the potential of generating supernatural literature.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the next generation, two towering figures&#x2014;Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x2014;chose starkly different means to convey the supernatural. Hawthorne, plagued by an overriding sense of sin inspired by the religious fanaticism of the Puritan settlers of Massachusetts, found in the American seventeenth century&#x2014;culminating in the real-life horror of the Salem witchcraft trials&#x2014;a fitting analogue of the European Dark Ages, and his novels and tales, supernatural and otherwise, constantly draw upon the Puritan past as a source of evil that continues to cast its shadow over the present.<br> &nbsp;<br> Poe, younger and more forward-looking, felt the need to found his horrors on the potentially hideous aberrations of the human mind, with the result that much of his best fiction falls into the category of psychological horror (&#x201c;The Tell-Tale Heart,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Man of the Crowd&#x201d;). As he noted somewhat aggressively in the preface to Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque (1840), in defending himself from accusations that many of his horrors were borrowed from European examples, &#x201c;I maintain that terror is not of Germany, but of the soul.&#x201d; And yet, Poe rarely strayed from the supernatural; indeed, many of his most distinctive tales chart the progressive breakdown of the ratiocinative intellect when faced with the &#x201c;suspension of natural laws.&#x201d; Poe also recognized that compression was a key element in producing the frisson of supernatural terror: in accordance with his strictures on the &#x201c;unity of effect,&#x201d; he understood that an emotion so fleeting as that of fear could best be generated in short compass, and for a century or more his example compelled the great majority of literary supernaturalists to adhere to the short story as the preferred vehicle for the supernatural. Indeed, it could be said that &#x201c;The Fall of the House of Usher&#x201d; is a kind of rebuke to those countless British Gothicists who had dissipated the vital core of their supernatural conceptions by extending it over novel length: here, instead, was a &#x201c;Gothic castle&#x201d; every bit as terrifying as that of Otranto or Udolpho, but concentrated in a fraction of the space. Poe achieved this condensation by a particularly dense, frenetic prose style that could easily be mocked (and would in fact be mocked by such a fastidious writer as Henry James), but whose emotive power is difficult to gainsay.<br> &nbsp;<br> Poe, then, is the central figure in the entire history of American&#x2014;and, indeed, British and European&#x2014;supernatural fiction; for his example, once established, raised the bar for all subsequent work. No longer could such entities as the vampire or the ghost&#x2014;already becoming stale through overuse and, more signifiantly, through the advance of a science that was rendering them so implausible as to become aesthetically unusable&#x2014;be manifested without proper emotional preparation or the provision of at least a quasilogical rationale; no longer could fear be displayed without an awareness of its psychological effect upon those who encounter it. And yet, over the next half-century or more after Poe&#x2019;s death, we can find no writer who focused singlemindedly upon either supernatural or psychological horror as Poe had done; indeed, excursions into the supernatural emerged almost at random from writers recognized for their work in the literary mainstream. This may indeed suggest that the supernatural was not, properly speaking, a genre clearly dissociated from general literature, but a mode into which writers of all stripes could descend when the logic of their conceptions required it.<br> &nbsp;<br> And so we have the examples of F. Marion Crawford, popular historical novelist, writing the occasional short story, and even one or two novels, of the supernatural; it may or may not be significant that these short stories were collected only posthumously in the volume Wandering Ghosts (1911). Another popular writer, Robert W. Chambers, began his career writing a scintillating collection of the supernatural, The King in Yellow (1895), but lamentably failed to follow up this promising start, instead descending to the writing of shopgirl romances that filled his coffers but spelled his aesthetic ruination. Edward Lucas White, also better known for his historical novels, persistently recurred to the supernatural in his short stories, notably in two substantial collections, The Song of the Sirens (1919) and Lukundoo (1927).<br> &nbsp;<br> If any figure can be said to have followed in Poe&#x2019;s footsteps, it is the sardonic journalist Ambrose Bierce. From the 1870s until his mysterious disappearance in 1914, his occasional &#x201c;tales of soldiers and civilians&#x201d; danced continually on either side of the borderline between supernatural and psychological horror. Bierce became the hub of a West Coast literary renaissance that featured other writers such as W. C. Morrow, Emma Frances Dawson, and even the young Jack London, all of whom dabbled in the supernatural. Short fiction comprised only a relatively minor proportion of Bierce&#x2019;s total literary output&#x2014;he was best known in his time as a fearless, and feared, columnist, chiefly for the Hearst papers&#x2014;and, while he may have derived inspiration both from Poe&#x2019;s example and from his theories on short fiction construction, the literary mode he evolved could not have been more different from Poe&#x2019;s: a prose style of stark simplicity and spare elegance, a detached, cynical, occasionally misanthropic portrayal of hapless protagonists in the grip of irrational fear, and a probing utilization of the topography of the West in contrast to the never-never lands of Poe&#x2019;s imagination. Indeed, Bierce successfully answered Hazlitt&#x2019;s old query by showing that even a land as raw and new (again, in terms of Anglo-Saxon settlement) as the West could be the source of terror: the abandoned shacks and deserted mining towns of rural California become the mauvaises terres of the Biercian imagination, lending a grim distinctiveness to tales whose relatively conventional ghosts and revenants might otherwise relegate them to second-class status. And of course Bierce followed Poe in the meticulous etching of the precise effects of the supernatural upon the sensitive consciousness of his fear-raddled protagonists.<br> &nbsp;<br> If Bierce was the head of the West Coast school of weird writing in his time, Henry James was, perhaps by default, the leader of the East Coast school. Like so many other mainstream writers, he found the supernatural&#x2014;manifested almost exclusively in the form of ghosts&#x2014;a perennially useful mode for the expression of conceptions that could not be encompassed within the bounds of mimetic realism. And yet, James rarely tipped his hand unequivocally in the direction of the supernatural, instead mastering the technique of the ambiguous weird tale, where doubt is maintained to the end whether the supernatural has actually come into play or whether the apparently ghostly phenomena are merely the products of psychological disturbance on the part of the characters. Preeminent among James&#x2019;s contributions in this regard is The Turn of the Screw (1898), which has inspired an entire library of criticism debating whether the revenants at the focus of the tale are or are not genuinely manifested; clearly James did not wish the question to be answered definitively. In short stories written over an entire career he probed the same questions, and his final, fragmentary novel, The Sense of the Past, might have been his greatest contribution to weird literature had he lived to complete it. James&#x2019;s compatriot Edith Wharton manifestly followed in his footsteps&#x2014;perhaps, indeed, at times a bit too closely. Nevertheless, there is enough originality and artistry in her dozen or so ghost stories to earn her a place in the supernatural canon.<br> &nbsp;<br> H. P. Lovecraft joins Poe and Bierce in the triumvirate of towering American supernaturalists. In a career that spanned little more than two decades, Lovecraft transformed the horror tale in such radical ways that its ramifications are still being felt. Although an early devotee of Poe, Lovecraft was also a diligent student of the sciences and came to the realization that the standard tropes of supernatural fiction&#x2014;the ghost, the vampire, the witch, the haunted house&#x2014;had become so played out and so clearly in defiance of what was then known about the universe that alternate means had to be employed to convey supernatural dread. Lovecraft found it in the boundless realms of space and time, where entities of the most bizarre sort could plausibly be hypothesized to exist, well beyond the reach of even the most advanced human knowledge. This fusion of the supernatural tale with the emerging genre of science fiction (canonically dated to the...</p></p><h2>Practical Solitary Magic</h2><p><p>Many students don't want to be tied to a particular group or spiritual tradition, but prefer to search, experiment, and grow on their own; this book is perfect for these people.

The depth and breadth of content is amazing. I highly commend this to you." (Steve Moore, president, Missio Nexus, author of Who Is My Neighbor? Being a Good Samaritan in a Connected World)<br><br>"We are privileged to live in an amazing era of history.

Lucid, chilling and comprehensive, Lucy S. Dawidowicz&#39;s classic tells the complete story of the Nazi Holocaust--from the insidious evolution of German Anti-Semitism to the ultimate tragedy of the Final Solution.Lucy S. Dawidowicz was educated at Hunter College and Columbia University in New York and studied East European Jewish life firsthand at the Yivo Institute of Jewish Research, formerly in Vilna, Poland. She has taught modern Jewish history at Yeshiva University, Stanford University, and the State University of New York at Albany.</p><h2>Imaro</h2><p>Imaro is a rousing adventure... a tale of a young man&#x2019;s continuing struggle to gain acceptance amongst his people, and to break the cycle of alienation and violence that plagues his life. <br><br> Imaro is heroic fantasy like it&#x2019;s never been done before. Based on Africa, and African traditions and legends, Charles Saunders has created Nyumbani (which means &#x201c;home&#x201d; in Swahili), an amalgam of the real, the semi-real, and the unreal. Imaro is the name of the larger-than-life warrior, an outcast, who travels across Nyumbani, searching for a home. <br><br> Like his contemporaries, Karl Edward Wagner (Kane) and Michael Moorcock (Elric), Charles Saunders brings something new to the traditional heroic fantasy tale. A broad knowledge of, and passion for, the history and myths of Africa led to the creation of a heroic fantasy character the likes of which the world has never seen. Imaro is no Tarzan... no Conan... Imaro is a warrior out of African legend.<br><br>Saunders' novel fuses the narrative style of fantasy fiction with a pre-colonial, alternate Africa. Inspired by and directly addresses the alienation of growing up an African American fan of Science Fiction and Fantasy, which to this day remains a very ethnically homogonous genre. It addresses this both structurally (via its unique setting) and thematically (via its alienated, tribeless hero-protagonist). The tribal tensions and histories presented in this fantasy novel reflect actual African tribal histories and tensions, and provide a unique perspective to current and recent conflicts in Africa, particularly the Rwandan genocide and the ongoing conflict in The Sudan.</p><p><p>CCharles Saunders, born July 12, 1946, is an African-American author and journalist currently living in Canada. During his long career, he has written everything from novels both fiction and non-fiction, to screenplays and radio plays.</p>Mixing quasi history and legend, Saunders's episodic heroic fantasy, first published in 1981 and now greatly revised, introduces Imaro, a black African in the heroic mold of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian. Set in the sub-Saharan equivalent of Howard's imaginary Hyborea, this origin story, the first in a projected five-volume series, tells how Imaro (who seems to run afoul of sorcerers as readily as Howard's barbarian did) is falsely accused at the conclusion of his manhood rite, exiled from his tribe and transformed into an embittered, homicidal wanderer in a landscape of savage beasts and savage men, yet retains, as such heroes usually do, a certain chivalrous decency. The unusual setting more than makes up for the routine plot. Saunders alone has appreciated the potential of Africa as a backdrop for heroic fantasy. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Drawing on attachment, developmental trauma, implicit processes, and neurobiology, major theorists from Allan Schore to Daniel Stern have argued how and why regulated affect is key to our optimal functioning. This book translates the intricacies of the theory into a cogent clinical synthesis.<br><br> With clarity and practicality, Hill decodes the massive body of contemporary research on affect regulation, offering a comprehensible and ready-to-implement model for conducting affect regulation therapy.<br><br> The book is organized around the four domains of a clinical model: (1) a theory of bodymind; (2) a theory of optimal development of affect regulation in secure attachment relationships; (3) a theory of pathogenesis, in which disordered affect regulation originates in relational trauma and insecure attachment relationships; and (4) a theory of therapeutic actions targeted to repair the affect regulating systems.<br><br> The key themes of Hill&#x2019;s affect-focused approach include: how and why different patterns of affect regulation develop; how regulatory patterns are transmitted from caretakers to the infants; what adaptive and maladaptive regulatory patterns look like neurobiologically, psychologically, and relationally; how deficits in affect regulation manifest as psychiatric symptoms and personality disorders; and ultimately, the means by which regulatory deficits can be repaired. Specific chapters explore such subjects as self states, mentalization, classical and modern attachment theory, relational trauma (and its manifestations in chronic dissociation, personality disorders, and pervasive dissociated shame), supporting self-development in therapy, patient&#x2013;therapist attunement, implicit and explicit therapeutic actions, and many more.</p><p><p><strong>Daniel Hill, PhD,</strong> is a psychoanalyst, educator and a leading proponent of the affect regulation model. His publications and presentations include topics ranging from the clinical use of multiple models to religious fundamentalism. The founder/director of PsyBC (1996-2014), he is currently the Editor-in-Chief of CSAR.NYC (the Center for the Study of Affect Regulation. CSAR.NYC conducts yearly conferences and workshops. Privately, Dr. Hill conducts on-going study groups focused on an in depth understanding of the regulation of affect. He is in private practice in NYC where he is on the faculties of the National Institute of the Psychotherapies and the New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy. Dr. Hill can be contacted at danhill@psybc.com.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Allan N. Schore, PhD</strong>, is on the clinical faculty of the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, and at the UCLA Center for Culture, Brain, and Development. He is the recipient of the American Psychological Association Division 56: Trauma Psychology "Award for Outstanding Contributions to Practice in Trauma Psychology" and APA's Division 39: Psychoanalysis "Scientific Award in Recognition of Outstanding Contributions to Research, Theory and Practice of Neuroscience and Psychoanalysis."He is also an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association. He is author of three seminal volumes,&nbsp;<em>Affect Regulation and the Origin of the Self, Affect Dysregulation and Disorders of the Self</em> and <em>Affect Regulation and the Repair of the Self</em>, as well as numerous articles and chapters. His Regulation Theory, grounded in developmental neuroscience and developmental psychoanalysis, focuses on the origin, psychopathogenesis, and psychotherapeutic treatment of the early forming subjective implicit self. His contributions appear in multiple disciplines, including developmental neuroscience, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, developmental psychology, attachment theory, trauma studies, behavioral biology, clinical psychology, and clinical social work. His groundbreaking integration of neuroscience with attachment theory has lead to his description as "the American Bowlby" and with psychoanalysis as "the world's leading expert in neuropsychoanalysis." His books have been translated into several languages, including Italian, French, German, and Turkish.</p>&#x201c;With&nbsp;<em>Affect Regulation Theory</em>, Daniel Hill makes an invaluable contribution to the growing field of psychotherapy that is reflective of a psychobiological perspective. The book is well written, well researched, and comprehensive. For any therapist seeking to broaden his or her theoretical knowledge base, with the ultimate goal of incorporating that information into clinical practice, I recommend reading this book first and foremost.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Stan Tatkin, PsyD, MFT, clinician, researcher, teacher, and developer of A Psychobiological Approach To Couples Therapy� (PACT)</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Understanding affect is central to human psychology. From the start, Freud was concerned with the vicissitude of how emotions connected to ideas and to their transformations into symptoms and psychopathology. And yet psychoanalysis has been slow to develop a comprehensive theory of affects. Daniel Hill is a master teacher, and in&nbsp;<em>Affect Regulation Theory&nbsp;</em>he demonstrates how affects and their regulation and dysregulation are central to our sense of agency, authenticity, and interpersonal relations. He grounds his understanding in psychoanalysis, attachment theory, and neurobiology and illuminates the clinical relevance of relational trauma, dissociation, and self-states, thus integrating a comprehensive theory of mind, development, psychopathology, and psychotherapy. This book is essential reading for graduate students and clinicians.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Lewis Aron, PhD, Director, New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy &amp; Psychoanalysis</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Daniel Hill has written a beautiful, user-friendly translation and elaboration of the theories of Allan Schore, Daniel Siegel, and Peter Fonagy. Illustrating with clinical vignettes, Hill integrates affect regulation, early attachment trauma, and theories of neurobiology. This is an excellent book for the working clinician.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Beatrice Beebe, PhD, Clinical Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry, NYS Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Affect regulation theory is the surprising meeting ground of neurobiology, developmental psychology, and psychoanalysis. In this important book, Daniel Hill captures its relevance to each of these realms. His book not only enhances our understanding of the physiological basis of emotions but also illuminates how emotional trauma in childhood emerges from prolonged states of dysregulation. Wonderfully comprehensive and engagingly written, this book will be a book to students. But it will also captivate those of us whose education preceded these exciting cross-disciplinary developments.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert B.

Now he offers a completely new book, providing fresh, iconoclastic ideas about the relationship between the brain and the mind.<p> In The New Executive Brain, Goldberg paints a sweeping panorama of cutting-edge thinking in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology, one that ranges far beyond the frontal lobes. Drawing on the latest discoveries, and developing complex scientific ideas and relating them to real life through many fascinating case studies and anecdotes, the author explores how the brain engages in complex decision-making; how it deals with novelty and ambiguity; and how it addresses moral choices. At every step, Goldberg challenges entrenched assumptions. For example, we know that the left hemisphere of the brain is the seat of language--but Goldberg argues that language may not be the central adaptation of the left hemisphere. Apes lack language, yet many also show evidence of asymmetric hemispheric development. Goldberg also finds that a complex interaction between the frontal lobes and the amygdale--between a recently evolved and a much older part of the brain--controls emotion, as conscious thoughts meet automatic impulses. The author illustrates this observation with a personal example: the difficulty he experienced when trying to pick up a baby alligator he knew to be harmless, as his amygdala battled his effort to extend his hand. <i>The New Executive Brain</i>, Goldberg affirms Goldberg's place as one of our most creative and insightful scientists, offering lucid writing and bold, paradigm-shifting ideas.</p></p><p><br><strong>Elkhonon Goldberg, Ph.D.</strong> is Clinical Professor of Neurology, New York University School of Medicine.

There are a handful, a small handful, of remarkable books which address these central problems with great force - those of Gerald Edelman and Antonio Damasio at once come to mind - and to this select number, Elkhonon Goldberg's book, <em>The Executive Brain</em>, should surely be added." -- <em>Oliver Sacks, The New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Anyone who is interested in the workings of the brain, 'science's last frontier', will enjoy reading <em>The Executive Brain</em>� The author's use of personal narrative and compelling metaphors help to make even the most technical information accessible to the general audience." -- <em>Science Editor</em><p></p><br>"Goldberg is a good example of someone who seems to have always thought out of the box in both his personal and professional life.

He also offers clear and generally accessible analogies that elucidate the role of the frontal lobes in everyday life. In earlier chapters, however, he introduces a number of elaborate theories relating intricate neuroanatomical and neurochemical systems (extending well beyond the frontal lobes) to complex cognitive processes; and, in later chapters, he goes "inside the black box" as he devises advanced computational-neuroscience models of his ideas.

Now, in this groundbreaking book, Peter Heather proposes a stunning new solution: Centuries of imperialism turned the neighbors Rome called barbarians into an enemy capable of dismantling an Empire that had dominated their lives for so long. <br>A leading authority on the late Roman Empire and on the barbarians, Heather relates the extraordinary story of how Europe's barbarians, transformed by centuries of contact with Rome on every possible level, eventually pulled the empire apart. He shows first how the Huns overturned the existing strategic balance of power on Rome's European frontiers, to force the Goths and others to seek refuge inside the Empire. This prompted two generations of struggle, during which new barbarian coalitions, formed in response to Roman hostility, brought the Roman west to its knees. The Goths first destroyed a Roman army at the battle of Hadrianople in 378, and went on to sack Rome in 410. The Vandals spread devastation in Gaul and Spain, before conquering North Africa, the breadbasket of the Western Empire, in 439. We then meet Attila the Hun, whose reign of terror swept from Constantinople to Paris, but whose death in 453 ironically precipitated a final desperate phase of Roman collapse, culminating in the Vandals' defeat of the massive Byzantine Armada: the west's last chance for survival.<br><br>Peter Heather convincingly argues that the Roman Empire was not on the brink of social or moral collapse. What brought it to an end were the barbarians.<br></p><p><p>In this ground-breaking book, Peter Heather proposes a new solution to one of the greatest mysteries of history: the demise of the Roman Empire.

As a result, we are losing a sense of the concrete and imposing presence of the real, and the fundamental claim it makes on us, a claim that Iris Murdoch once described as the essence of love. In response to this postmodern predicament, the present book aims to draw on the classical philosophical tradition in order to articulate a robust philosophical anthropology, and a new appreciation of the importance of the &#34;transcendental properties&#34; of being: beauty, goodness, and truth. The book begins with a reflection on the importance of metaphysics in our contemporary setting, and then presents the human person&#39;s relation to the world under the signs of the transcendentals: beauty is the gracious invitation into reality, goodness is the self-gift of freedom in response to this invitation, and truth is the consummation of our relation to the real in knowledge. The book culminates in an argument for why love is ultimately a matter of being, and why metaphysical reason in indispensable in faith.</p><p>D. C.

Peter Edgeworth, Viscount Whitleaf, frowned at the letter he had been reading as he folded it and set it down beside his breakfast plate.<br><br>John Raycroft, seated at the opposite end of the table, lowered the morning paper from in front of his face and raised his eyebrows.<br><br>"Bad news?"<br><br>Peter sighed audibly.<br><br>"I have been really looking forward to going home," he said, "despite the fact that I have enjoyed the last couple of weeks here with you and your family and hate to drag myself away when the whole neighborhood has been so hospitable. I have been actually eager to go at last, dash it all. But I made the mistake of letting my mother know my intention, and she has planned a grand welcome home. She has invited a houseful of guests to stay for a few weeks, including a Miss Rose Larchwell, whoever the devil she may be. I have never heard of her. Have you? I tell you, Raycroft, this is no laughing matter."<br><br>But his protest came too late. John Raycroft was already chuckling as he set down the paper and gave his full attention to his friend. They had the room to themselves, the rest of the family having breakfasted earlier while the two of them were still out riding.<br><br>"Clearly your mother is eager to marry you off," John said. "It is hardly surprising, Whitleaf, when you are her only son and in the wrong half of your twenties."<br><br>"I am only twenty-six," Peter protested, frowning again.<br><br>"And five years older than you were the last time your mother tried something similar&#x2013;and failed," Raycroft reminded him, still grinning. "Doubtless she thinks it is high time she tried again. But you can always say no&#x2013;as you did last time."<br><br>"Hmm," Peter said again, not sharing his friend's amusement. That was an episode in his life that had been far from funny. He had outraged the ton, which collectively believed that he had come far too close to betrothing himself to Bertha Grantham to withdraw honorably, even though no formal announcement had yet been made. And he had delighted the younger male members of the beau monde, who had thought him one devil of a fine fellow for thumbing his nose at the polite world by crying off from a leg shackle at the last possible moment.<br><br>Dash it, it had not been funny at all. He had been at the tender age of twenty-one, innocent as a babe in arms, and cheerfully proceeding along the path through life his family and guardians had mapped out for him. Good God, he had even fallen dutifully in love with Bertha because it was expected of him. He had not even realized he possessed such a thing as a backbone until shock had caused him to flex it and put an end to that almost-engagement in a damnably gauche and public manner. It had been a very raw and painful backbone for a long time after that, though he had flexed it again only an hour or so later by sending his uncles&#x2013;and former guardians&#x2013;packing with the declaration that since he had reached his majority he did not need them any longer, thank you very much. Though he was not at all sure he had thanked them.<br><br>"The thing is," he said, "that the girl's hopes have possibly been raised, or her mama's anyway&#x2013;not to mention her father's and her sisters' and brothers' and grandparents' and cousins'. Lord!"<br><br>"Perhaps," John Raycroft said, "you will like her, Whitleaf. Perhaps she will live up to her name."<br><br>Peter grimaced. "I probably will," he agreed. "I like women in general. But that is not the point, is it? I don't intend marrying her&#x2013;or anyone else not of my own choosing&#x2013;even if she is as lovely as a thousand roses combined. And so I will be in the impossible situation of having to be courteous and amiable to her without giving the impression that I am courting her. And yet everyone else at this infernal house party will know very well why she has been invited&#x2013;my mother will see to that. I tell you, Raycroft, you can wipe that grin off your face anytime you like."<br><br>John Raycroft laughed again as he tossed his napkin on top of the newspaper.<br><br>"My deepest commiserations, old chap," he said. "It is a nasty affliction to be rich and titled and eligible&#x2013;and to have been known since the tender age of twenty-one as a breaker of hearts. That fact only adds to your attractions, of course, at least as far as the gentler sex is concerned. But you are going to have to marry sooner or later. It is one of the obligations of your rank. Why not sooner?"<br><br>"But why not later?" Peter said hastily, picking up his knife and fork and tucking into what remained of his eggs and ham. "I am not like you, Raycroft. I cannot look upon a woman across a crowded ballroom one evening, recognize her as the one and only love of my life, court her devotedly to the exclusion of all others for a whole year, and then be content to betroth myself to her and wait for another year while she gallivants off to the ends of Europe."<br><br>"To Vienna to be precise," his friend said. "With her parents, who planned the treat for her aeons ago. And not for a full year, Whitleaf. They will be back next spring. We will be married before the summer is out. And one of these days you will know why I would wait three times as long if I had to. Your problem is that you are undiscriminating. You only have to look at a woman to fall in love with her. You fall in love with everyone&#x2013;and therefore with no one."<br><br>"There is safety in numbers." Peter grinned reluctantly. "But I say, Raycroft&#x2013;I do not exactly fall in love with women, you know. I just like them."<br><br>He did too&#x2013;perhaps fortunately. It was only love or any other deep commitment that he had cried off. But his liking for women&#x2013;and for all people, come to that&#x2013;had saved him from moving from babe in arms to cynic in the course of one ghastly day.<br><br>His friend shook his head.<br><br>"What are you going to do, then?" he asked, nodding in the direction of the letter. "Go home and land slap in the middle of your mother's matchmaking party or stay here at Hareford House? Why not change your mind about leaving tomorrow and stay for the full month after all? Write and tell your mama that I was devilish disappointed when I heard you were planning to cut your visit short. Tell her my mother was brokenhearted. Tell her you feel obliged to stay for the village assembly the week after next. None of those facts would be an outright lie. In fact, the neighborhood will probably go into deep mourning if you do not make an appearance at the assembly. It might be canceled for lack of interest. It is a good thing I am betrothed to Alice and secure in her affections. Being with you is enough to plunge any unattached fellow into mortal gloom. No other male exists for the ladies when you are within a ten-mile radius."<br><br>Peter laughed&#x2013;though he was still not really feeling amused.<br><br>The thing was that after five years of floundering around with only his own very limited wisdom to guide him, leading meanwhile the empty, aimless existence of a typical young gentleman about town, he had finally made a few firm decisions about his future.<br><br>It was time to go home to Sidley Park. For five years he had made only brief visits there before returning to his life in London or Brighton or at one of the spas.<br><br>It was time to take charge of his life and his estate and the responsibilities that went with his rank.<br><br>It was time, in other words, to grow up and be the man he had been educated to be&#x2013;and actually the man he had always dreamed of being, even if the dream had been interrupted for rather too long. He had grown up loving Sidley and the knowledge that it was his and had been since the death of his father when he was three.<br><br>Aimless pleasure was not really for him, he had decided during the Season in London this year. Neither were wild oats, though he had sown a few. He had wasted five years of his life. Though they had not been wholly wasted, he supposed. He had learned to stand on his own feet even if he was still not as firm on them as he hoped to be. And he had learned to filter through everything he had been taught by a loving mother and five sisters, and by a host of strict guardians, to decide what was important and what was to be permanently rejected.<br><br>They had let him down badly five years ago, those guardians&#x2013;not to mention his mother. But basically, he had come to realize, they had given him a sound upbringing. It was time to stop feeling sorry for himself and punishing himself as well as them&#x2013;it was time to become the person he wanted to be. No one else could do that but him after all.<br><br>It had felt enormously satisfying to put himself finally in charge of his own life.<br><br>Of course, he had promised to spend a month at Hareford House with Raycroft after the Season was over, and he would honor that promise, he had decided, and go home afterward. But the closeness of the Raycroft family, the warmth of their dealings with one another and with their friends and neighbors, had only strengthened his resolve and his yearning finally to be master of his own home. And so he had decided to cut short his visit and go home to Sidley Park after only two weeks. It was already late August and the harvest would be ready soon. He longed to be home for it this year and to stay home.<br><br>Now his mother's letter had put a dent in his dreams. It appalled him that she appeared to have been so little affected by the events of five years ago. Or perhaps she was merely trying to make amends in the only way she knew how. It was her dream to see him settled in life with a wife and a few children in the nursery.<br><br>They were interrupted before he could reply to Raycroft's invitation by the arrival in the breakfast parlor of Miss Rosamond Raycroft, John's young sister, who was looking rosy-cheeked and bright-eyed and remarkably pretty after an hour spent out in the garden gathering flowers with her mama. Peter looked at her with affectionate appreciation as she kissed her brother's cheek and then turned a deliberately pouting face toward him. He stood to draw back a chair for her.<br><br>"I am quite out of charity with you," she said as she took the seat. "You might have agreed to stay a little longer."<br><br>"You break my heart," Peter said, resuming his own place. "But I am not at all out of charity with you. I have something to beg of you, in fact, since you are dazzling my eyes with your beauty and would have robbed me of appetite if I had not already eaten. I humbly beg you, Miss Raycroft, to reserve the opening set at the coming assembly for me."<br><br>The mock pout disappeared, to be replaced with a look of youthful eagerness. "You are staying after all?" she asked him. "For the assembly?"<br><br>"How can I resist?" He set his right hand over his heart and regarded her soulfully. "You ought not to have gone out into the sunshine and fresh air this morning and improved upon your already perfect complexion. You ought to have appeared here pale and wan and dressed in your oldest rags. Ah, but even then I fear I would have found the sight of you irresistible."<br><br>She laughed.<br><br>"Oh, you are staying," she said. "And I am dressed in my oldest rags, silly. You are staying. Oh, I knew you were just teasing when you insisted that you must leave tomorrow. I shall dance with you&#x2013;of course I shall. You would not know how very few young gentlemen ever attend the assemblies, Lord Whitleaf. And even many of the ones who do attend play cards all evening or merely stand about watching as if it would kill them to dance."<br><br>"It probably would, Ros," her brother said. "It is a strenuous thing, dancing."<br><br>"The Calverts will positively expire of envy when they know that I have already been engaged for the opening set, and by no less a person than Viscount Whitleaf," Miss Raycroft continued, clapping her hands together. "I shall tell them this morning. I promised to go over there so that we can all go out walking together. You really ought to ask Gertrude for the opening set, John. You know Mama and Mrs. Calvert will expect it even if you are betrothed to Alice Hickmore. And Gertrude will be relieved. If she has promised to dance it with you, she will not be able to dance it with Mr. Finn, who was born with two left feet, both of them overlarge, the poor gentleman."<br><br>Peter grinned.<br><br>"I'll come with you and ask her now," John said cheerfully. "Finn is a farmer and a dashed good one too, Ros. And he could shoot a wren between the eyes at a hundred paces. One cannot expect him to be an accomplished dancer too."<br><br>"Shoot a wren?" Miss Raycroft paused with her hand stretched toward the toast rack and looked stricken. "What a horrid idea. I certainly hope he does not ask me to dance."<br><br>"It was merely a figurative way of speaking," her brother told her. "What would be the use of shooting wrens? Nobody would eat them anyway."<br><br>"Nobody would shoot a wren for any reason at all," Peter assured the girl as he got to his feet. "They are gentle, beautiful birds. I shall accompany you on the walk too, if I may, Miss Raycroft. The weather and the countryside alone would tempt me, but even if it were raining and cold and blowing a gale, the company would be quite irresistible."<br><br>She acknowledged the blatant flattery with a bright smile and eyes that still twinkled. She was seventeen years old, not yet officially "out," and she knew as well as anyone that he was not seriously smitten with her charms&#x2013;or with anyone else's of her acquaintance for that matter. He would not have dared flatter and flirt with her if there were any likelihood that she might misunderstand&#x2013;her brother was his closest friend and he was staying in their parents' home.<br><br>"I shall go up and change my clothes and wash my hands and face," she said, getting to her feet again, the toast forgotten. "I shall be ready in fifteen minutes."<br><br>"Make it ten, Ros," her brother said with a sigh. "You look perfectly decent to me as you are."<br><br>Peter, meeting her pained glance, winked at her.<br><br>"Go and improve further upon perfection if it is possible," he said. "We will wait for you even if you take twenty minutes."<br><br>It seemed, he thought ruefully, that his decision had been made. He was not going home after all. Not yet, anyway.</p><h2>Life Energy: Using the Meridians to Unlock the Hidden Power of Your Emotions</h2><p>One of the most important medical books of the twentieth century, a ground-breaking classic that has never been out of print since it first appeared in 1983, and which remains as relevant today as ever. Essential reading for anyone interested in holistic health, psychology and the relation between the two.</p><p>Here, for the first time, is a comprehensive explanation of how to unlock the hidden power within every one of us. This power, our <i>LIFE ENERGY</i>, determines our mental and physical states -- and Dr. John Diamond shows how to unleash this energy.<br> <br><b>You can use <i>LIFE ENERGY</i> to:</b> <ul><li><b>Lead a more productive, creative, and happy life</b></li><li><b>Achieve your full potential</b></li><li><b>Deal positively with mental and physical stress</b></li><li><b>Reduce negative emotional states (hatred, anger, jealousy etc.) and increase positive emotions (love, faith, courage etc.)</b></li><li><b>Prevent and overcome illness and maintain good health</b></li><li><b>Look younger as you learn to erase the lines of self-doubt and unhappiness from your face</b></li></ul> Dr. Diamond's discovery of how to release <i>LIFE ENERGY</i> is based on the twelve acupuncture meridians, each of which relates to a specific emotional state. Using the simple muscle test described in this book, you can assess these emotional states in yourself or anyone else. Then, by practising a short daily meditational program, you will keep your emotions and meridians balanced so that you achieve maximum <i>LIFE ENERGY</i> and enjoy mental and physical well-being and harmony every day of your life.Dr. John Diamond graduated from Sydney University Medical School in 1957 and was awarded his Diploma in Psychological Medicine in 1962. He is a Fellow of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatry, a Foundation Member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, American Holistic Medical Association, a Diplomate of the International College of Applied Kinesiology and a Fellow and past President of the International Academy of Preventive Medicine. He is an Honorary Advisor to the Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation and their Japanese sister organization, the Koushikai Foundation. <br> <br>One of the foremost holistic healers, Dr. Diamond's remarkable body of work, which includes his discovery of the link between the acupuncture meridians and the emotions, embraces a wide range of disciplines, the result of over fifty years of research and clinical practice. He began his career in psychiatry but expanded into holistic medicine, concentrating on the totality of the sufferer. In his fifty years of practice, he has increasingly recognized that there is within us a great healing force, Life Energy, the healing power within. With his increasing involvement with this concept, his research has led him to concentrate on the enhancement of the sufferer's Life Energy so as to actuate his own innate Healing Power. <br> <br>Dr. Diamond has held numerous senior clinical and university teaching appointments in clinical psychiatry, the basic sciences and the humanities, and is a recognized bestselling author of over twenty books, including "Your Body Doesn't Lie," "Life Energy: Unlocking the Hidden Power of Your Emotions to Achieve Well-Being," "The Diamond Color Meditation," "Facets of a Diamond: Reflections of a Healer" and numerous books on music and healing. He has a large international following, and his books have been translated into a number of languages including German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish, Japanese and Greek.</p><h2>God Grew Tired of Us: A Memoir</h2><p>"Lost Boy" John Bul Dau&#x2019;s harrowing experience surviving the brutal horrors of Sudanese civil war and his adjustment to life in modern America is chronicled in this inspiring memoir and featured in an award-winning documentary film of the same name. Movingly written, the book traces Dau&#x2019;s journey through hunger, exhaustion, terror, and violence as he fled his homeland, dodging ambushes, massacres and attacks by wild animals. His tortuous, 14-year journey began in 1987, when he was just 13, and took him on a 1,000-mile walk, barefoot, to Ethiopia, back to Sudan, then to a refugee camp in Kenya, where he lived with thousands of other Lost Boys. In 2001, at the age of 27, he immigrated to the United States. With touching humor, Dau recounts the shock of his tribal culture colliding with life in America. He shares the joy of reuniting with his family and the challenges of making a new life for himself while never forgetting the other Lost Boys he left behind.</p><p>John Bul Dau is a Dinka from Southern Sudan and one of thousands of Lost Boys who fled their homeland during Sudanese civil war. He found shelter at refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya before coming to Syracuse, New York, where he now lives with his wife and his daughter. <br><br>Michael S. Sweeney is a professor of journalism at Utah State University. He is the author of the acclaimed book <i>Secrets of Victory,</i> which was named 2001 Book of the Year by the American Journalism Historians Association.Just 13 in 1987 when he was driven from his village and separated from his family in the raging civil war in southern Sudan, John Bul Dau spent years in refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya, until in 2001 he came to the U.S. as one of 4,000 Lost Boys of Sudan. His memoir is the subject of a new, award-winning documentary film. Like Deng's <i>They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky </i>(2005)<i>,</i> this is a stark, first-person account of trauma and survival. Dau tells it quietly, in fast, simple prose true to the young teen's viewpoint. He's funny about the culture shock in America and honest about his years in the camp, even the fact that, trauma notwithstanding, he liked being tabbed as a leader. Although appreciative of this country and the chance for work and college, he never denies his connections to Africa. Unforgettable photos document his reunion--after 19 years--with family he did not know were alive. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The dumbest show she'd ever heard was playing on the car radio, a chat hour called "Hootenanny," and George found it hilarious. He had a distinctive, infectious laugh that seemed to emanate from an invisible center and radiate outward. It started as a soft vibration, then crescendoed to a sound of pure happiness. And it wasn't just the radio show. George had recently received word that his grandson was coming home from the war in Afghanistan, and that added to his cheerfulness. He anticipated a reunion any day now.<br><br>Very soon, she hoped, for both their sakes.<br><br>"I can't wait to see Ross," said George. "He's my grandson. He's just been discharged from the army, and he's supposed to be on his way back."<br><br>"I'm sure he'll come to see you straightaway," she assured him, pretending he had not just told her this an hour ago.<br><br>The springtime foliage blurred past in a smear of color&#x2014;the pale green of leaves unfurling, the yellow trumpets of daffodils, the lavish purples and pinks of roadside wildflowers.<br><br>She wondered if he was thinking about the fact that this would be his last springtime. Sometimes her patients' sadness over such things, the finality of it all, was unbearable. For now, George's expression was free of pain or stress. Although they'd only just met, she sensed he was going to be one of her more pleasant patients.<br><br>In his stylish pressed slacks and golf shirt, he looked like any well-heeled gentleman heading away from the city for a few weeks. Now that he'd ceased all treatment, his hair was coming back in a glossy snow-white. At the moment, his coloring was very good.<br><br>As a private-duty nurse specializing in palliative care for the terminally ill, she met all kinds of people&#x2014;and their families. Though her focus was the patient, he always came with a whole host of relatives. She hadn't met any of George's family yet; his sons and their families lived far away. For the time being, it was just her and George.<br><br>He seemed very focused and determined at the moment. And thus far, he reported that he was pain free.<br><br>She indicated the notebook he held in his lap, its pages covered with old-fashioned spidery handwriting. "You've been busy."<br><br>"I've been making a list of things to do. Is that a good idea?" he asked her.<br><br>"I think it's a great idea, George. Everybody keeps a list of things they need to do, but most of us just keep it up here." She tapped her temple.<br><br>"I don't trust my own head these days," he admitted, an oblique reference to his condition&#x2014;glioblastoma multiforme, a heartlessly fatal cancer. "So I've taken to writing everything down." He flipped through the pages of the book. "It's a long list," he said, almost apologetically. "We might not get to everything."<br><br>"All we can do is the best we can. I'll help you," she said. "That's what I'm here for." She scanned the road ahead, unused to rural highways. To a girl from the exhausted midurban places of Jersey and the sooty bustle of Manhattan, the forest-clad hills and rocky ridges of the Ulster County highlands resembled an alien landscape. "It's not such a bad idea to have too many things to do," she added. "That way, you'll never get bored."<br><br>He chuckled. "In that case, we're in for a busy summer."<br><br>"We're in for whatever summer you want."<br><br>He sighed, flipping the pages. "I wish I'd thought about these things before I knew I was dying."<br><br>"We're all dying," she reminded him.<br><br>"And how the devil did I luck into a home health care worker with such a sunny disposition?"<br><br>"I bet a sunny disposition would drive you crazy." Although she and George were new to each other, she had a gift for reading people quickly. For her, it was a key survival skill. Misreading a person had once forced Claire to change every aspect of her life.<br><br>George Bellamy struck her as circumspect and well-read. Yet he had an air of loneliness, and he was seeking...something. She hadn't discovered precisely what it was. She didn't know a lot about him yet. He was a retired international news correspondent of some renown. He'd spent most of his adult years living in Paris and traveling the globe. Yet now at the end of his life, he wanted to journey to a place far different fromthe world's capitals.<br><br>Lives came to an end with as much variety as they were lived&#x2014;some quietly, some with drama and fanfare, some with a sense of closure, and far too many with regrets. They were the slow poison that killed the things that brought a person joy. It was amazing to her to observe the way a generally happy, successful life could be taken apart by a few regrets. She hoped George's searching journey would be to a place of acceptance.<br><br>Those who were uninitiated in her area of care seemed to think that the dying knew the answers to the big questions, that they were wiser or more spiritual or somehow deeper than the living. This, Claire had learned, was a myth. Terminally ill patients came in all stripes&#x2014;wise, foolish, filled with happiness or despair, logical, loony, fearful...in fact, the dying were very much like the living. They just had a shorter expiration date. And more physical challenges.<br><br>The countryside turned even prettier and more bucolic as they wended their way northwest toward the Catskills Wilderness, a vast preserve of river-fed hills and forests. After a time, they approached their target destination, marked by a rustic sign that read, Welcome To Avalon. A Small Town With A Big Heart.<br><br>Her grip tightened almost imperceptibly on the steering wheel. She'd never lived in a small town before. The idea of joining an intimate, close-knit community&#x2014;even temporarily&#x2014;made Claire feel exposed and vulnerable. Not that she was paranoid, or&#x2014;wait, she was. But she had her reasons.<br><br>There was no place that ever felt truly safe to her. The early days with her mother, even before all the trouble started, had been fraught with unpredictability and insecurity. Her mother had been a teenage runaway. She wasn't a bad person, but a bad addict, shot during a drug deal gone wrong on Newark's South Orange Avenue and leaving behind a quiet ten-year-old daughter.<br><br>Her life was transformed by the foster care system. Not many would say that, but in this instance, it was entirely true. Her caseworker, Sherri Burke, made sure she was placed with the best foster families in the system. Experiencing family life for the first time, she inhaled the lessons of life from people who cared. She learned what it was like to be a part of something larger and deeper than herself.<br><br>To appreciate the blessings of a family, all she had to do was watch. It was everywhere&#x2014;in the look in a woman's eyes when her husband walked through the door. In the touch of a mother's hand on a child's feverish brow. In the laughter of sisters, sharing a joke, or the protective stance of a brother, watching out for his siblings. A family was a safety net, cushioning a fall. An invisible shield, softening a blow.<br><br>She dared to dream of a better life&#x2014;a love of her own, a family. Kids. A life filled with all the things that made people smile and feel a cushion of comfort when they were sad or hurting or afraid.<br><br><em>This can be yours</em> was the promise of the system, when it was working as it should.<br><br>Then, at the age of seventeen, everything changed. She had witnessed a crime that forced her into hiding&#x2014;from someone she had once trusted with her life. If that wasn't a rationale for paranoia, she didn't know what was.<br><br>A small town like this could be a dangerous place, especially for a person with something to hide. Anyone who read Stephen King novels knew that.<br><br>If worse came to worst, then she would simply disappear again. She was good at that.<br><br>She'd learned long ago that the witness protection programs depicted in the movies were pure fiction. A simple murder was not a federal case, so the federal witness protection program&#x2014;WITSEC&#x2014;was not an option for her. This was unfortunate, because the federal program, expertly administered and well-funded by the U.S. marshals, had a track record of effectively protecting witnesses without incident.<br><br>State and local programs were a different story. They were invariably underfunded. Taxpayers didn't relish spending their money on these programs. The majority of informants and witnesses were criminals themselves, trading information for immunity from prosecution. The total innocents, such as Claire had been, were a rarity. Often, witness protection consisted of a one-way bus ticket and a few weeks in a motor court. After that, the witness was on her own. And for a witness like Claire, whose situation was so dangerous she couldn't even trust the police, sometimes the only ally was luck.<br><br>Now the families she had been a part of so briefly seemed like a dream, or a life that had happened to someone else. She used to believe she'd have a family of her own one day, but now that was out of her reach. Yes, she could fall in love, have a relationship, kids, even. But why would she do that? Why would she create something in her life to love, only to expose it to the threat of being found out? So here she was, trapped into an existence on the fringes of other people's families. She tried so hard to make it work for her, and sometimes it did. Other times, she felt as though she was drifting away, like a leaf on the wind.<br><br>"Almost there," she said to George, noting the distance tracker on the GPS.<br><br>"Excellent. The journey is so much shorter than it seemed to me when I was a boy. Back then, everyone took the train."<br><br>George had not explained to her exactly why he had decided to spend his final time in this particular place, nor had he told her why he was making the trip alone. She knew he would reveal it in due course.<br><br>People's end-of-life experiences often involved a journey, and it was usually to a place they were intimately connected with. Sometimes it was where their story began, or where a turning point in life occurred. It might be a search for comfort and safety. Other times it was just the opposite; a place where there was unfinished business to be dealt with. What this sleepy town by Willow Lake was to George Bellamy remained to be seen.<br><br>The road followed the contours of a burbling tree-shaded stream marked the Schuyler River, its old Dutch spelling as quaint as the covered bridge she could see in the distance. "I can't believe there's a covered bridge. I've never seen one before, except in pictures."<br><br>"It's been there for as long as I can remember," George said, leaning slightly forward.<br><br>Claire studied the structure, simple and nostalgic as an old song, with its barn-red paint and wood-shingled roof. She accelerated, curious about the town that seemed to mean so much to her client. This might turn out to be a good assignment for her. It might even be a place that actually felt safe for once.<br><br>No sooner had the thought occurred to her than a blue-white flash of light battered the van's rearview mirror. A split second later came the warning <em>blip</em> of a siren.<br><br>Claire felt a sudden frost come over her. The tips of her fingernails chilled and all the color drained from her face; she could feel the old terror coming on with sudden swiftness. She battled a mad impulse to floor the accelerator and race away in the cumbersome van.<br><br>George must have read her mind&#x2014;or her body language. "A car chase is not on my list," he said.<br><br>"What?" Flushed and sweating, she eased her foot off the accelerator.<br><br>"A car chase," he said, enunciating clearly. "Not on my list. I can die happy without the car chase."<br><br>"I'm totally pulling over," she said. "Do you see me pulling over?" She hoped he couldn't detect the tremor in her voice.<br><br>"There's a tremor in your voice," he said.<br><br>"Getting pulled over makes me nervous," she said. Understatement. Her throat and chest felt tight; her heart was racing. She knew the clinical term for her condition, but it was the layman's expression she offered George. "Kind of freaks me out." She stopped on the gravel verge and put the van in Park.<br><br>"I can see that." George calmly drew a monogrammed gold money clip from his pocket. It was filled with neatly folded bills.<br><br>"What are you doing?" she demanded, momentarily forgetting her anxiety.<br><br>"I suspect he'll be looking for a bribe. Common practice in third world countries."<br><br>"We're not in a third world country. I know it might not seem like it, but we're still in New York."<br><br>The patrol car, black and shiny as a jelly bean, kept its lights running, signaling to all passersby that a criminal was being apprehended.<br><br>"Put that away," she ordered George.<br><br>He did so with a shrug. "I could call my lawyer," he suggested.<br><br>"I'd say that's premature." She studied the police car through the van's side mirror. "What is taking so long?"<br><br>"He&#x2014;or she&#x2014;is looking up the vehicle records to see if there's been an alert on it."<br><br>"And why would there be an alert?" she asked. The van had been leased in George's name with Claire listed as an authorized driver.<br><br>Yet something about his expression put her on edge. She glanced from the mirror to her passenger. "George," she said in a warning voice.<br><br>"Let's just hear the officer out," he said. "Then you can yell at me."<br><br>The approaching cop, even viewed through the side mirror, stirred a peculiar dread in Claire. The crisp uniform and silvered sunglass lenses, the clean-shaven square jaw and polished boots all made her want to cringe.<br><br>"License and registration," he said. It was not a barked order but a calm imperative.<br><br>Her fingers felt bloodless as she handed over her driver's license. Although it was entirely legitimate, even down to the reflective watermark and the organ donor information on the back, she held her breath as the cop scrutinized it. He wore a badge identifying him as Rayburn Tolley, Avalon PD. George passed her the folder containing the van's rental documents, and she handed that over, too.<br><br>Claire bit the inside of her lip and wished she hadn't come here. This was a mistake.<br><br>"What's the trouble?" she asked Officer Tolley, dismayed by the nervousness in her voice. No matter how much time had passed, no matter how often she exposed herself to cops, she could never get past her fear of them. Sometimes even a school crossing guard struck terror in her.<br><br>He scowled pointedly at her hand, which was trembling. "You tell me."<br><br>"I'm nervous," she admitted. She had learned over the years to tell the truth whenever possible. It made the lies easier. "Call me crazy, but it makes me nervous when I get pulled over."<br><br>"Ma'am, you were speeding."<br><br>"Was I? Sorry, Officer. I didn't notice."<br><br>"Where are you headed?" he demanded.<br><br>"To a place called Camp Kioga, on Willow Lake," said George, "and if she was speeding, the fault is mine. I'm impatient, not to mention a distraction."<br><br>Officer Tolley bent slightly and peered across the front seat to the passenger side. "And you are...?"<br><br>"Beginning to feel harassed by you." George sounded righteously indignant.<br><br>"You wouldn't...</p><h2>Woodswoman II: Beyond Black Bear Lake</h2><p><p><strong>"If you&#x2019;re looking for a real declaration of independence, and a deeper social experiment, try a woman living alone in the Adirondacks for decades." &#x2015;Megan Mayhew Bergman, <em>Guardian</em></strong></p><p>Anne LaBastille found peace and solitude in the log cabin she built for herself at Black Bear Lake.

His books have sold more than a million copies worldwide and he has won, or been short-listed for, every major award for Young Adult literature in Australia, including the Children&#39;s Book Council of Australia Children&#39;s Book of the Year, the National Children&#39;s Book awards and numerous children&#39;s choice awards. The gripping war series, which began with Tomorrow when the War Began, has broken all sales records for young adult fiction. Burning for Revenge was awarded the Bookdata-ABA Book of the Year Award (1998). John Marsden&#39;s move into picture books has been highly acclaimed, following the release of Prayer for the 21st Century in 1997, Norton&#39;s Hut in 1998 and The Rabbits in 1999. Combining simple language with sophisticated illustrations, The Rabbits is both an educational and engaging account of &#39;otherness&#39; in which John Marsden&#39;s versatility and ability to talk directly to his young readers is demonstrated once again. ILLUSTRATORBIO: Shaun Tan has an outstanding reputation for his illustrative work. He won the Crichton Award for Book Illustration (The Viewer) in 1995. His collaborative effort with John Marsden, The Rabbits was named CBC Picture Book of the Year in 1999. Memorial was his third picture book. He has been a leading science-fiction illustrator in Australia for several years; with recognition including the Illustrators of the Future Award (1991) and the Australian National Science Fiction Best Artist Award (1995, 1996). He contributes regular political cartoons to the Western Review and is the art editor and a regular contributor to Eidelon magazine.Grade 2-8-An allegorical picture book about ecological and cultural destruction, illustrated with remarkable and highly stylized art. Small, reddish-brown armadillo/numbatlike creatures describe what happens when newcomers arrive in their homeland-"The rabbits came many grandparents ago...." Their numbers and technology take over, with devastating effects: "Sometimes we had fights, but there were too many rabbits.... They chopped down our trees and scared away our friends... and stole our children." In the end, the land is devastated and the animals wonder, "Who will save us from the rabbits?" The brief, bleak text is simple, and its message fairly obvious, but it is the stunning ink, oil, and wash artwork that adds complexity and the visual experience of a culture and landscape being overrun. The sharp-angled, streamlined white rabbits in formal suits and uniforms start out the same size as their rounded unclothed compatriots, but soon take over the foreground in ever-expanding size. The tiny innocent smokestack of their first vehicle and the predatory prow of their massively looming ship become the ominous portent of mechanization that runs amok. Though aspects of both illustrations and text make the parable particularly pertinent to Australia, the nonspecific language and highly stylized art are easily generalized and parallels can be drawn to any study of colonial history. The story's point of view provides a clear understanding of, and unsentimental empathy with, the experience of indigenous cultures, while its extraordinary art offers a thought-provoking, powerful look at a land and people overwhelmed.<i>-Nancy Palmer, The Little School, Bellevue, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She lives in San Francisco.Introduction<br> <b>Igniting a Passion</b><br> A great grilled meal stays with you, as does the experience of cooking one around a fire. Some of the happiest times of our lives have been celebrated around a grill. The two of us&#x2014;now the husband-and-wife chef-owners of Ox Restaurant in Portland, Oregon&#x2014;fell in love while cooking over a wood-fired grill in Napa Valley. That was in 1999, and you might say we&#x2019;ve been on a quest to share our passion for the grill ever since. Maybe our story makes us a little biased toward this style of cooking. But we have a strong feeling that you, too, have some good memories tied to gathering around a fire and grilling.<br><br> That first grill where we worked together was at chefs Hiro Sone and Lissa Doumani&#x2019;s restaurant Terra in St. Helena, California. This Michelin-starred wine country restaurant was also where we first met, and where we both cooked professionally for the first time over a mesquite-fueled fire. Our job was smoky, it was sweaty, and it was flat-out the most inspiring way either of us had ever prepared food. <br><br> Any chance we had, we would daydream about and make plans for opening a restaurant with a wood-fired grill of our own someday.<br><br> In between our jobs at Terra, getting married, and opening Ox thirteen years later, the two of us cooked and ate in various parts of the world, Hawaii, Italy, and Spain among them. When creating our plans for our restaurant, Ox, we knew that&#x2014;in addition to the influences we took home from these regions&#x2014;we also wanted to incorporate flavors and inspirations from Gabi&#x2019;s Latin American roots. She spent almost every summer of her youth at her family&#x2019;s home in the Andean highlands of Quito, Ecuador, developing a love for local flavors and traditions while watching her grandmother cook foods like empanadas, hominy stew, and all kinds of seafood ceviches. We also knew we would build our menu around what&#x2019;s in season, as well as make sure we offered something for everybody&#x2014;vegetarians, food-sensitive diners, everybody.<br><br> With our grill goals in mind, we studied the flavors and techniques of one of the best grilling regions in the world: Argentina. There, a simple grill grate propped over a fire and a dedication to using all parts of an animal yield dramatic, meaty masterpieces. Meals last hours, platters are always heaping, and dining companions are generous and hospitable. There is an idea among Argentinians that what comes from their own land is the best there is&#x2014;and that it is all you need for a meal.<br><br> At Ox, we do Argentinian-style grilling with a Pacific Northwest approach. We cook over an open-fire Argentinian grill, known traditionally as a <i>parrilla</i> (pronounced pah-ree-sha), and much of our menu celebrates the bounty&#x2014;vegetable, seafood, and meat&#x2014;of the area surrounding Portland, our home since 2008. When we moved here, something about the community told us instantly it was the right place to open our restaurant. In this part of the country, people are passionate about ingredients and open-minded about cuisine. We are forever flattered and grateful that they embraced our concept with open arms&#x2014;a South American&#x2013;style grill with a Portland-esque respect for local ingredients and eating by the seasons.<br><br> While Portland and Ox are very special to us, we believe that what we do at Ox&#x2014;and everything we have learned from our travels to South America and Europe&#x2014;can be more or less replicated wherever you are. The pages of this book are designed to inspire you to have an affair with your own grill&#x2014;be it wood-fired, charcoal-fueled or, yes, even gas&#x2014;and bring people together around it. (In our Grilling Basics section on page 5, there are tips for maximizing the potential of whatever style of grill you have.)<br><br> Of course, there&#x2019;s a reason a gorgeous crackling fire often lures people to gather around and stay awhile. Besides being warm and giving nourishment, it&#x2019;s relaxing and enchanting, something that can intrigue and mesmerize you for hours. We hope that the ideas and recipes inside this book will tickle the same elemental urges and instincts as fire itself does, and ignite some adventure in both your backyard and kitchen&nbsp;cooking.<br><br> When we visited Argentina and Uruguay together, we were so moved by the resourcefulness and cleverness of the chefs and hosts we met. They can make a grill out of anything, and they apply the fire&#x2019;s magic to the most unlikely cuts of meat. Drawing inspiration from these traditions, we&#x2019;ve taken a leap in using some lesser-known cuts and ingredients in this book. We promise they are worth your while to seek out. But even if you don&#x2019;t, there is plenty in these pages to suit and surprise you.<br><br> As for steaks, oh yes, they are here, and they are divine. But we&#x2019;ve picked other proteins that we are almost more excited for you to try, like shoulder chops instead of rack of lamb, fish tails instead of fillets, and spiced morcilla sausages instead of spicy Italian. We are convinced these other types of protein will not only encourage you to think outside your grill routines but also might save you some cash and probably become why-didn&#x2019;t-I-think-of-that favorites. We don&#x2019;t like to be stuck in ruts as chefs, and we believe no home cook or host should suffer that fate either.<br><br> Of course, extraordinary grilling is not just about meat. At Ox, the grill grate is just as often covered with stunning seasonal vegetables&#x2014;like enormous artichokes tenderizing to perfection and singeing on the ends, or halves of golden spaghetti squash or summer cantaloupes sliced down the center and left to soften and caramelize over the embers. These are the dishes that surprise many of our first-time restaurant diners, because we are not a traditional steak house, and these are not your traditional North American grill recipes.<br><br> Regarding the barbecue sauces and bottled condiments that are strategically missing from these pages, here&#x2019;s our take: grilled foods create their own natural, succulent, and luscious juices, so why waste them? We harness those drippings and season them with fresh, pungent herbs and spices, like bundles of rosemary and cloves of garlic; then we use these newly seasoned drippings to baste our grilled foods in their own amped-up natural juices. And when we need a condiment, we turn to the Argentinian classic: glistening, pungent chimichurri.<br><br> More than just give ideas, we&#x2019;ll teach you how to break down and prepare more flavorful cuts of protein, and provide seasonings, bastes, flavorings, and techniques that will hopefully allow you to expand the list of foods&#x2014;not just familiar cuts of meat but also veggies, fruit, seafood, and offal&#x2014;you get inspired to grill. We&#x2019;ll also share some fun finishing touches to try. We take pleasure in the look on diners&#x2019; faces when they see fresh truffle shaved over their grilled leg of goat, or when they dip their spoon into the jalape�o-laced smoked marrow bone that sits atop our clam chowder. These flourishes can be omitted, but we urge you to try them since it is worth it to go the extra mile. This book is about sharing craft and creativity, inspiring new menus, and helping to create new associations with the grill and new memories around it.<br><br> A very important distinction we&#x2019;d like to make&#x2014;and one we think sets our book apart from other grilling books out there&#x2014;is that not every dish that follows is cooked on the grill. To us, saut�ed side dishes, crisp salads, creamy soups, chilled ceviches, and roasted and toasted elements of all kinds are essential accents that help bring balance to every meal, including grill-centric ones. We do not expect man to live off the grill alone. Though that would not be a tragic fate.<br><br> Our vision is that these recipes will help promote more than just cooking seriously good food but also the joy of sharing it, hosting with ease, and spending relaxed hours around the table. This kind of cooking and eating harkens back to our travel experiences in South America and Europe&#x2014;some of our best memories ever of eating&#x2014;where family-style feasts are everyday occurrences and where it seems the simpler the food, the more awe it inspires. It mirrors the technique, flavors, and heart of places where we have found so much inspiration: Argentina, Uruguay, and Ecuador. Their cooking is the epitome of simplicity and soul, and like the Europeans, they know how to execute and enjoy a long, lovely meal like the best of them. As the world gets closer and smaller&#x2014;communication and travel are easier, and people are taking trips near and far to expand their food experiences&#x2014;everybody seems to be on a quest to find and re-create that same feeling these far-flung places foster. Here&#x2019;s the secret we want to share: it&#x2019;s right in your own backyard.<br> &#x2014;Greg and Gabi</p><h2>I Am the Beggar of the World: Landays from Contemporary Afghanistan</h2><p><p><b>An eye-opening collection of clandestine poems by Afghan women</b><br><b></b></p><p>Because my love's American,<br>blisters blossom on my heart.</p><p>Afghans revere poetry, particularly the high literary forms that derive from Persian or Arabic. But the poem above is a folk couplet&#x2015;a <i>landay</i>, an ancient oral and anonymous form created by and for mostly illiterate people: the more than 20 million Pashtun women who span the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. War, separation, homeland, love&#x2015;these are the subjects of <i>landays</i>, which are brutal and spare, can be remixed like rap, and are powerful in that they make no attempts to be literary. From Facebook to drone strikes to the songs of the ancient caravans that first brought these poems to Afghanistan thousands of years ago, <i>landays</i> reflect contemporary Pashtun life and the impact of three decades of war. With the U.S. withdrawal in 2014 looming, these are the voices of protest most at risk of being lost when the Americans leave.<br> After learning the story of a teenage girl who was forbidden to write poems and set herself on fire in protest, the poet Eliza Griswold and the photographer Seamus Murphy journeyed to Afghanistan to learn about these women and to collect their <i>landays</i>. The poems gathered in <i>I Am the Beggar of the World</i> express a collective rage, a lament, a filthy joke, a love of homeland, an aching longing, a call to arms, all of which belie any facile image of a Pashtun woman as nothing but a mute ghost beneath a blue burqa.</p></p><p><p><b>Eliza Griswold,</b> a Guggenheim fellow, is the author of a collection of poems, <i>Wideawake Field</i> (FSG, 2007) and a nonfiction book, <i>The Tenth Parallel: Dispatches from the Fault Line Between Christianity and Islam</i> (FSG, 2010), a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller that was awarded the J. Anthony Lukas Prize. She has worked with Seamus Murphy in Africa and Asia for more than a decade. She lives in New York City.</p><p><b>Seamus Murphy</b> has photographed extensively in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Latin America. His photography from Afghanistan, begun in 1994, chronicles the tumultuous life of the Afghan people. A collection of this work, titled <i>A Darkness Visible: Afghanistan</i>, was published in 2008 and was produced as an award-winning film. He has won seven World Press Photo Awards. He lives in London.</p><p>&#x201c;Griswold's translations mark a stunning handling of [landay's] complex 'beauty, bawdiness, and wit.' Flanked by Murphy's photographs, with their striking blend of wartime journalism and human compassion, Griswold's couplets are peppered with brief prose passages in which she delves into cultural and historical traditions that inform the humor and gravity of her translations . . . a collection that may indeed be remembered as a groundbreaking work of translation and poetic journalism.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Eliza Griswold and Seamus Murphy have made a book that is necessary reading for anyone who has ever made assumptions from a distance about what a burka-wearing woman might be like, and for anyone who cannot fathom how poetry could get you killed. In other words, this book is a must-read for every U.S. citizen . . . Griswold's and Murphy's work might be a crucial turning point in the education of Americans about the real world--and the place of poetry in it.&#x201d; &#x2015;Daniel Bosch, <i>The Daily Beast</i></p><p>&#x201c;The book's greatest strength is the complicated spectrum of voices that it allows these women, whom we wouldn't otherwise know anything about. <i>I Am the Beggar of the World</i> casts Pashtun women as vibrantly self-aware and autonomous . . . Griswold finds a way to present these poems and images in juxtaposition so that they evoke a multiplicity of voices and views, giving an almost democratic quality to the anthology's populace.&#x201d; &#x2015;Jay Deshpande, <i>The Millions</i></p><p>&#x201c;*<b>Starred review</b>* From heartbreaking indictments of fathers who sell their daughters into slavery to humorous, techno-savvy posts on a Pashto Landay Facebook page, Griswold's selections illustrate the rich potential of this poetic form, at once contemporary and timeless. Murphy's stunning photographs complement the text perfectly, capturing children at play in refugee camps outside Kabul, smiling U.S. soldiers pointing squirt guns, and armed militants marching through the mountains. A timely, indispensable, and unforgettable poetic documentary.&#x201d; &#x2015;Diego B�ez, <i>Booklist Starred Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>I Am the Beggar of the World</i>, translated by journalist and poet Eliza Griswold, with photos by Seamus Murphy, collects passionate, polemical, and traditionally secret two-line folk poems by Pashtun women on topics ranging from education, war, and personal autonomy to marriage, faith, loss, and homeland.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Elle</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>I Am the Beggar of the World</i> is a great and satisfying work. I applaud Eliza Griswold and Seamus Murphy. It is an essential look at the women of Afghanistan and the voices of dissent at risk of being suppressed when the American forces withdraw.&#x201d; &#x2015;Sahera Sharif, Member of Afghanistan&#x2019;s Parliament, founder of nationwide women&#x2019;s literary circle, Mirman Baheer</p><p>&#x201c;The poems in <i>I Am the Beggar of the World </i>cut like a knife--they are short, sharp--and leave you bleeding. They are the most direct voices of the inner life of Afghan women, and prove that these women, despite all hardships, are still standing. These two-liners make the reader feel close to the women that we've seen so often on the screen wandering like blue-clad ghosts on the dusty roadsides. A heart is a heart anywhere in the world.&#x201d; &#x2015;�sne Seierstad, author of The Bookseller of Kabul</p><p>&#x201c;<i>I Am the Beggar of the World</i> is a revelatory book about Afghanistan, one sure to turn all the stereotypes about the country's women on their heads. The poems, equally art and reportage, are often poignant, more often witty, even pungent. They, along with the accompanying text and photographs, illuminate the beauty of the country and its culture, the sadness of its history, and the humor, the hopes, the bitterness, and even the contradictions its women--no different than women anywhere--carry in their hearts. This is an important book, but to describe it only that way is to neglect how deeply pleasurable it is to read.&#x201d; &#x2015;Amy Waldman, author of The Submission</p><p>&#x201c;Eliza Griswold brings a poet's sensibility, a folklorist's skills, and a journalist's savvy to these startling and incendiary folk poems by Afghan women, which she has so daringly collected and translated. With its arresting photographs and heartbreaking two-liners, <i>I Am the Beggar of the World</i> enlarges our sense of the work that poetry does in the world.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Edward Hirsch, author of The Living Fire</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is poetry of a rural tradition that is as world-wise, war-wise and uniquely sophisticated as any collection of writing by women, anywhere.&#x201d; &#x2015;Carol Muske-Dukes, author of Twin Cities</p></p><h2>Revolutionary Intercommunalism and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination</h2><p>The classic dialectic over self-determination and nationalism is brought to elegant synthesis in H.P.

The two of them play together until they accidentally break a vase. Lin's father is so angry that he insists the little creature be caged. The dragon escapes, and Lin goes to look for it. With the help of an old woman, a witch, she finds it living with the other dragons in the clouds, and grown up. The dragon returns Lin to her home, and her father agrees that they can visit often. Though the story is thin, the book is clever. Its purpose is to introduce the Chinese language, and it succeeds admirably. Each page contains one or more Chinese characters, which appear not only at the bottom with the English translation, but also superimposed on the drawings. In this way, Niemann emphasizes the connection between the lines of the character and the object it represents. The stylized illustrations are jaunty and appealing, and the use of red, a color representing good fortune in China, visually unifies the tale from beginning to end. Playful and humorous in his approach, Niemann includes some of the icons of Chinese culture, past and present-dragons, the Great Wall, Ping-Pong, and the ever-present giant cranes that are building modern China. Now that Mandarin is becoming a popular language choice in forward-looking communities, this title is sure to please.&#x2014;<i>Barbara Scotto, Children's Literature New England, Brookline, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When cries of &#x201c;Revolution!&#x201d; began, Christopher was determined to help General George Washington and his hungry troops. Not with muskets or cannons, but with gingerbread!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheerfully told by Mara Rockliff and brought to life by Vincent Kirsch&#x2019;s inventive cut-paper illustrations, <i>Gingerbread for Liberty</i> is the story of an unsung hero of the Revolutionary War who changed the course of history one loaf at a time.</p><p>Mara Rockliff enjoys writing books for kids and baking gingerbread and other treats.

This book relates the tale of a generous, beloved, and industrious member of the Philadelphia community, originally from Germany, referred to as "the baker." The book centers on his insistence upon joining the war effort, despite being told he's too old and fat. George Washington put the baker to work baking bread for the troops and eventually sent him on a special mission to convince the mercenary Hessian soldiers to abandon the English army. Rockliff's dialogue-laden text is accessible, even humorous at times ("General Washington did not say the baker was old and fat. General Washington was too polite. Anyway, he had other troubles on his mind."). Rendered in watercolor, the charming illustrations aptly depict the people and objects as gingerbreadlike, using a palette of warm, cinnamon tones and sugary white lines that detail the free-floating, cut-paper shapes. Repetitive shapes with a lack of depth complete the cookie illusion. The simple recipe on the end pages offers options for different skill levels. Back matter, including a list of sources, provides fuller detail and context as well as the baker's name: Christopher Ludwick. A sweet addition to Revolutionary War units where a more behind-the-scenes look is desired and a nonfiction twist on gingerbread-themed storytimes.&#x2014;Carol S.

It was love at first sight. At first the men decided to hide the pup from the Commander, thinking she wouldn&#x2019;t be allowed. But soon enough all of the men in the barracks fell hard for the little dog. Then one day when high waves challenged another vessel at sea, it was Vera&#x2019;s fierce determination and natural swimming ability that brought the life preserver and safety line to the sinking boat.

The men in the unit were charmed by the playful mutt but feared their commander, the Ol' Man, would give her away if she were discovered, so they kept her hidden. One day, a distress call came in from a sailboat caught in a horrific storm, and the company (including the Ol' Man) raced out to aid the trapped passengers. The harsh winds and unforgiving rip currents prevented any rescue attempts, and it was at that moment that Vera appeared on deck. The men convinced the Ol' Man that she could swim out and bring a lifeline to the terrified passengers, and in desperation he agreed. It was a tremendous and daring effort that resulted not only in saved lives but also in a lifelong friendship between the commander and Vera. Polacco expertly depicts the enduring love between man and canine through her engaging text and energetic and joyous illustrations. The book chronicles even more courageous rescues by Vera, and the ending will pull at heartstrings. Never maudlin, this inspiring offering is sure to captivate. Polacco's own role in the story is intriguing, and the author's note will spark lively conversation.

The epic, 1,800-million-year geologic story behind this amazing landscape is even more awe inspiring. In <i>Geology Underfoot along Colorado&#x2019;s Front Range</i>, the most recent addition to the Geology Underfoot series, authors (and geoscientists) Lon Abbott and Terri Cook narrate the Front Range&#x2019;s tale, from its humble beginnings as a flat, nondescript seafloor through several ghostly incarnations as a towering mountain range. The book&#x2019;s 21 chapters, or vignettes, lead you to easily accessible stops along the Front Range&#x2019;s highways and byways, where you&#x2019;ll meet the apatosaur and other dinosaurs who roamed the floodplains and beaches that once covered the Front Range; look for diamonds in rare, out-of-the-way volcanic pipes; learn how America&#x2019;s mountain, Pikes Peak, developed from molten magma miles below the surface only to become an important visual landmark for early Great Plains&#x2019; travelers; and walk the Gangplank, a singularly important plateau for both nineteenth-century westward expansion and our understanding of the Front Range&#x2019;s most recent exhumation. A healthy dose of full-color illustrations and photos demystify the concepts put forth in the authors&#x2019; elegant, insightful prose. With <i>Geology Underfoot along Colorado&#x2019;s Front Range</i> in hand, you&#x2019;ll feel like you&#x2019;re traveling through time as you explore the Front Range&#x2019;s hidden geologic treasures.</p><p>Lon Abbott is a geology faculty member at the University of Colorado at Boulder whose recent research has focused on the cutting of the Grand Canyon and the formation of the Colorado Rockies.

But, like many skilled trades, the sign industry has been overrun by the techno-fueled promise of quicker and cheaper. The resulting proliferation of computer-designed, die-cut vinyl lettering and inkjet printers has ushered a creeping sameness into our visual landscape. Fortunately, there is a growing trend to seek out traditional sign painters and a renaissance in the trade. In 2010 filmmakers Faythe Levine, coauthor of <em>Handmade Nation</em>, and Sam Macon began documenting these dedicated practitioners, their time-honored methods, and their appreciation for quality and craftsmanship. <em>Sign Painters</em>, the first anecdotal history of the craft, features stories and photographs of more than two dozen sign painters working in cities throughout the United States.</p><p>Since graduating from High School Faythe Levine hasn t stopped working on project after project. Her interest in outsider communities, artists and the stories and people whom often get overlooked have propelled her to travel extensively. The constant in Faythe s 20 years of creative work is her dedication to documenting her day to day life and travels through photographs and correspondence (once handwritten letters, now more commonly through social networking sites). This dedication has allowed her creative community to have an international reach full of a variety of both famous and infamous people of all types. Sam Macon is a filmmaker. He directs television commercials, music videos, short form documentaries and Web based video content through production company Radar Studios. He also helms commercial projects in Paris through Cosa Productions and in Moscow with Bazaleves Films. He is currently working on the feature length documentary Sign Painters. In addition to directing, Sam has taught video production at the Chicago Portfolio School and has been a guest lecturer at DePaul University and Syracuse University."A lovely paean to a vanishing art... Ms. Levine and Mr. Macon have hopscotched the country, interviewing many of the best remaining old-school sign painters and printing their best work... This book, with an introduction by the artist Ed Ruscha, is a funky and necessary work of preservation." -- New York Times<br><br>"With hand-painted signs rapidly going the way of the film camera, documentarians Levine and Macon offer a welcome look at some of the remaining artists and their work, which adorns storefronts, walls and billboards. New Yorker Stephen Powers began as a graffiti artist; Las Vegas painters Mark and Rosie Oatis met in sign school; Ernie Gosnell, in Seattle, learned the trade as a teen from a sign-painting lady wrestler who "tattooed a little bit on the side." It's a toss-up as to what's better - these characters or their art." -- New York Post<br><br>"This is not only a wonderful book, a delight to take in, rich and telling in its details and a visual pleasure with its gorgeous photography. It's an important book that captures a largely untold story." -- Milwaukee Journal Sentinel<br><br>"Sign Painters is a great source of inspiration about this often-overlooked industry, and a good reminder to pay a little extra attention while out in the city, on the highway, or wherever. Beautiful hand-painted signs are everywhere." -- Smithsonian.com<br><br>"Full of stunning full-color shots of finished signs and works-in-progress of folks from San Francisco and Iowa City to Mazeppa and Boston. Even artist Ed Ruscha gets in on the action." -- Fast Company<br><br>"Every now and again, a book comes my way on a topic that is utterly and completely unexpected. Faythe Levine and Sam Macon's Sign Painters is the sort of artistic celebration that should be commonplace on the shelves.this is graphic design at its best; these signs command attention, enliven the landscape, and bring customers in... good stuff, and damned inspiring." -- Bookslut<br><br>"As lovingly hand made as the signs it celebrates... What comes across clearly is the respect for good work, letter by letter, that helps their clients' businesses succeed. This book captures the renaissance of the sign painter." --- Juxtapoz<br><br>"Artist Clark Byers may not be a household name, but if you've lived or traveled in the southeast U.S., you're probably familiar with his work. Byers, whose death in 2004 was commemorated with an obituary in the New York Times, painted the advertising slogan, "See Rock City," on the roofs of more than 900 barns from the late 1930s until the 1960s. Byers' and other artists' signs inspired filmmakers Sam Macon and Faythe Levine's great new book, Sign Painters, an homage to the craft and its craftsmen (and a great gift for the Americana-lover on your holiday shopping list)." -- Reader's Digest</p><h2>Cosmic Coupling: The Sextrology of Relationships</h2><p>Cosmic Coupling is a fun, fast-paced exploration of every �possible relationship between star signs, both straight and gay, from the authors&#x2019; unique sextrological perspective.

The sign's ruler, Mars, governs aggression and overt sexual drive. So, while Aries man is as directive as the planet's phallic symbol suggests&#x2014;a human hard-on, if you will&#x2014;Aries woman seeks to get a rise from a mate, if not have him firmly by the balls. Mars signals the Masculine Principle, making the Ram guy more a he-man than any other. For her, the planet incites a signature attraction to super-macho types. Few are man enough for this female connoisseur of the testosterone set. Compared to her, most males pale into pansies. She revels in butch company, dismissing guys with accessed feminine sides (along with most women) as feeble and fatuous. Aries guy fits her brutish bill, but there's a snag: He seeks to transcend his bestial impulses because they make him feel base. As such, he puts on the valiant veneer of a shining knight. But she is no damsel in distress, her trademark lamby looks deceiving. And just as he seeks to woo a lady fair, she refuses to stand on ceremony, especially when it comes to sex. He must put up and shut up. She sees right through his Clark Kent routine to the manhood of steel he conceals. No kid gloves: She expects male Ram to live up to that name.<br><br>COMPATIBILITY<br><br>Aries man can be a premier chauvinist. Not only is he oft turned off (read: threatened) by a female aggressor, he may find her cavalier sexual attitude suspect if not slaggish. He is the zodiac's Adam, the model-A man, just as she is the primordial female, like Adam's first wife, Lilith, who preferred it on top, being no compliant Eve. Aries affect each other's 1st house of individuation, separate identities and a need to exert swollen egos. No same-sign pairing is potentially so at odds, selfishness being a trait they share. Thus this bond often ends just as it begins. Though not before offering the most athletic sex imaginable. Aries is the physical sign. And confronted with so blatantly wanton a woman, he may unapologetically release the beast, without pretense of ever even phoning again. Fine by her. It therefore takes a self-realized Ram man to forge a relationship with the male-objectifying Ewe. It means forgoing the bulk of his valiant visions, embracing the primal primate he truly is. She, too, might bend her rules, letting him open doors and pull out chairs for her. She'll see it as servitude. When this coupling works, congratulations are in order. It means neither is reliant on oppressing the other for their own self-aggrandizement&#x2014;something she does by cuckolding a mate she finds lacking. Man-izing is her stock and trade. And the slightest whiff of manlier meat on the market can send her out to survey the livestock. Fortunately, no guy is more equipped than he to keep that from happening, as he must accept the role he was born to play: that of sexual crusader. He need know, or be led to believe, that he's calling the shots, lest he feel emasculated. In all other areas, she wears the pants, the bedroom being the only place she'll want to be bested.<br><br>CARNALITY<br><br>This is where his knight-errant tenacity finds practical use, as quenching her unslakeable fire is an eternal quest. No couple is in as perpetual a state of heat as these two. Their mutual lust is palpable. In their company, other couples can feel sexless, diminished. And don't think the Aries don't know it. Together, they are far more assertive than when solo. Just as they're wont to beat rivals on the tennis court, they'll also boast superiority in the sack. Swagger on that subject is intended to shrink another man's ego and shock a woman's sensibilities, if not pique her interest. Aries man will brag of his lady's insatiability. Aries woman will let slip it takes a superman to satisfy her. He might reveal she's an exhibitionist with a penchant for public places, or that she's so boisterous the neighbors have taken to wearing earplugs. He'll leak some tidbits about himself, too: his uncannily quick refraction period, the fact he's physically fit enough to pin her&#x2014;she loves to wrestle&#x2014;or the boon of being skilled at dirty talk, which fuels her passion to self-satisfy for his viewing pleasure, which, he'll omit, she does during sex, in any case (she won't solely rely on his usual missionary positioning to pop her cork). Indeed, both Aries are mainly in it for their own gain, any gratification they provide each other being a by-product of scratching personal itches. Sex isn't to be savored, it's a full-throttle ride to completion. And an element of force comes to define much of their routine&#x2014;he assumes the role of invader, she gleefully fights back. He will want her to play passive, even pushing an anal agenda. But she's not so inclined. And they're not overly oral, bidding the other to oblige with varying success. Even then, neither lies back and just enjoys it; rather, they bump, grind, and otherwise direct the proceedings. For even their receptive acts can read as aggressive. And just as their aesthetic taste is devoid of ornate flourishes, so, too, is their sex life free of frilly lingerie, mood lighting, or silky sheets. She would sooner do it on the floor in the brash glare of day. Of course, his dimestore-novel lusting for a compliant powder puff of a woman may develop into a roving eye, but she's got one, too. And not just for hunky men: Aries woman is fairly bisexual by nature, often sharing Aries male's penchant for overpowering a femmy female. Think of it as just another sport they excel at together, their combined sexual power packing a punch a third party won't soon forget. Oftentimes, they are unsentimental enough toward each other to support an outright swingle lifestyle. This allows them the opportunity to compete with other couples in a viable sexual arena where their shared prowess needn't be left to the imagination, but rather hit with a spotlight for all to envy. To boot, this provides extracurricular possibilities without that pesky adultery rap.<br><br>ARIES MAN + ARIES MAN<br><br>The Unspoken<br><br>CHEMISTRY<br><br>Aries men tend to gather in herds, attracted to the ubermasculinity their sex sign exudes. And they do so most often as friends, rather than as potential lovers. But nothing is out of the question in the Aries' mind. There is a tacit understanding that a one-off or regular rodgering between buddies won't stand in the way of lasting comradeship. Aries men are in no way precious, and they revel in the fact that emotion has zilch to do with their bond. Attraction is physical, and even their platonic relationships smack of it. They thrive on each other's brute power, fetishizing all things male whilst eschewing the more fey aspects of gay life. There is a spartan quality here. Like two soldiers&#x2014;a nod to their Mars rule&#x2014;they share an ascetic aesthetic, steering clear of metaphorically civilian life.<br><br>COMPATIBILITY<br><br>To Aries, conformity is for pussies, and they're drawn to each other's in-your-face attitude. They don't so much fuse as coexist, each expressing his individual rant in one-sided diatribes with no need for interaction, let alone approval. So, there may be a dearth of depth here. Like a stereotypical straight male bond, these guys don't analyze or deal in feelings. The pitfall is competitiveness, due to a shared need to be in charge. The most common lasting gay male Aries bond is one in which there is a significant age difference. Here, older Aries holds all the cards, the younger deferring to his wishes. Both are conscious of this dynamic, the more callow Aries modeling himself on his mentor. A father-son element allows the bond to endure while Aries of the same age often butt heads if having to cope with deeper partnership issues and joint decision making. Thus it rarely lasts forever.<br><br>CARNALITY<br><br>Aries man-to-man sex is a straightforward affair. Without the aforementioned age difference, Rams tend to struggle for dominance. This sign counts the least number of bottoms in their order. And as it is Aries' main goal to bend a guy over, and roughly at that, most Aries can't, or won't, accommodate the other's needs. A younger Aries may play catcher, but will seek out other butch bottoms to compensate for his own dominant desires. A bit of wrestling is de rigueur. And sports kit, military gear, and some leather may enter into the mix. Inevitably, this pair will seek out passive third parties to tag team and thereby supplement their oral diet&#x2014;neither is inclined to be all too giving on that score. Their sex life has little nuance. It's mainly predicated on penetration, and a lot of it. Muscles and body hair are huge turn-ons. No smooth, sensual twinks wanted. In fact, it's all very Fight Club: These warriors scarcely conceal their butch sexuality behind their sharpest business suits.<br><br>ARIES WOMAN + ARIES WOMAN<br><br>The Urge<br><br>CHEMISTRY<br><br>At first they clash, each projecting derision onto the other&#x2014;for being difficult, histrionic, bratty. Still, these Valkyries are galvanized by the other's blatant display of ego and overt sexuality, surfacing, initially, as signature aggression. Even two straight Aries feel a pheromonic tug here, which may result in a fleeting fling. They rile each other, neither able to fully wield alpha status. Typically, Aries woman must mask her foremost agenda&#x2014;sex&#x2014;negotiating the inherent emotionality of most lesbian bonds. Here, no. And once she figures out this fact, she finds herself staring down the barrel of her prurient counterpart's lust for her. Love is generally not in the initial offing. And it is the prospect of unfettered fun that is its own -self--propelled impetus for the pairing.<br><br>COMPATIBILITY<br><br>Aries can easily have sex at the top of the first date, neither girl banking upon it going any further. A pleasant surprise, then, as it often does. And for all her objectifying Mars energy, Aries looks to be the love-toy in this bond. Both seeking this, they play coy, the pairing, by its very existence, softening these usually hardened players. Empathy makes them tolerant of trademark brusqueness and ego flexing. And they enjoy healthy detachment in a bond that fosters fidelity which, let's face it, isn't typically Aries' strong suit. But this bond is all or nothing. They may work together, sharing as many aspects of life as possible. Ram women demand busloads of attention, which might preclude giving considered focus to a lover. So they look for validation from fawning friendships and flirtations. Aries revel in each other's tales of such come-ons, fostering a mythos of most desirable couple.<br><br>CARNALITY<br><br>Given their prolific natures, Aries must beware of inciting surplus jealousy since altercations on that score can get ugly. The Ram probably needs more sex than any other female on the astrological block. She is the queen of the quickies. And together, these two have it off like rabbits. Daily orgasms are de rigueur, even if via a tactile flicking or other such perfunctory contact on off-nights between full-on interaction. Hunger characterizes their intimacy; and they are equally wanting of both deepest penetration and taking on the task of aggressor, strapping on the required equipment to do just that. They are forever flipping, often many times in the course of a single session. There is little role-play, neither feeling a compulsion to take the part of femme. Rather, the bond will always sexually smack of two sporty schoolgirls roughly having it off. The least affectionate of lasses, even their kisses can leave scars. They're especially nondemonstrative in public, others assuming they're just galpals.<br><br>ARIES MAN + TAURUS WOMAN<br><br>The Classic<br><br>CHEMISTRY<br><br>This couple looks great on paper. He is the ubermasculine Adam archetype; she, the lady Eve, personifies femininity. He is drawn to what appears to be her pleasant, passive disposition. She prizes his signature aggression, which may've been lacking in her father figure. Longing to be swept off her feet, Taurus hopes the Aries knight, chivalrous and chauvinistic in equal measure, will treat her like a princess in public and a putana in bed. Aries, meanwhile, falls for her nymphy innocence, a snow white veneer that belies a namesake brand of sexual mania. Opposites attracting, the bantam-bodied, square-shouldered, stubbly Aries and the soft-skinned, doll-faced Taurus girly-girl prove the theory that men are from Mars and women, from Venus, their respective ruling planets. The fixed-earth sign, Taurus, is a metaphorical garden, demanding appreciation and, indeed, cultivation from a partner&#x2014;for the premier material girl, this typically requires hard, cold cash. Of any sign, Taurus prizes a hefty bankroll and assumes the go-getting Aries shares her view. But his ambitions aren't always financially motivated, and he may find her trademark attachment to possessions a tad shallow. In turn, she labels his signature lofty pursuits the stuff of which pipe dreams are made.<br><br>COMPATIBILITY<br><br>Taurus kindles Aries' astrological 2nd house, that of literal and figurative substance; so, through her, he learns to value and foster assets, whether intrinsic abilities or external trappings. She teaches him that money isn't the root of any evil, but rather a commodity to be valued, like time and talent. Aries stokes Taurus's cosmic 12th house, that of nonmaterial, "spiritual," even magical experience. His blind faith in his dreams (which brings about their manifestation) shows her how a singularity of purpose can create its own reality, creature comforts notwithstanding. But it takes time for such wisdom to be exchanged. Meanwhile, her need for financial security may weigh upon him; and she verbalizes her fears, perhaps too heavy-handedly, managing the business of their bond. Eventually, though, it works like a charm: Taurus grounds and monetizes Aries' self-starting enterprises; and he eases her out of defeatism (she calls it practicality), proving time and again the power of his cardinal-fire nature, forever sparked as it is by inspiration. Even when enjoying her own professional success, Taurus resolutely remains that great woman behind the man. Like Eve, she seduces her Aries Adam to take bigger bites out of life, offering sensual delight, coaxing him out of his signature spartan ways. She's comfortable atop the pedestal that Aries man seeks to place a woman, happy as a clam or Venus on the half shell to be objectified by her male, something the more "liberated" female signs might shudder to think about. Not her: She doesn't view equality and traditional female role-playing as mutually exclusive. And, of all the men in the zodiac, Aries wants to feel he has that stereotypical male sway. It serves Taurus' purpose just fine to let him believe that's actually the case.<br><br>CARNALITY<br><br>This couple tends to lead quite separate lives in the light of day, having different tastes in friends and ideas of fun. Sexually, however, divergent needs and desires give rise to connubial perfection.</p><h2>The Books of Magic 30th Anniversary Edition</h2><p><b>Award-winning author Neil Gaiman's tale of Timothy Hunter, a boy with the power to be the world's greatest magician, is once again available in trade paperback!</b><br><br>Some of the greatest mystics in the DC Universe, such as John Constantine and the Phantom Stranger, must aid Timothy Hunter in his decision on whether or not to become a powerful magician or return to his normal life.</p><p>Neil Gaiman is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>American Gods</i> and <i>Coraline</i> (illustrated by Dave McKean).

IT was also ten days after the first birthday of my beautiful daughter EC. And I was tired. Very tired. I am sure that&#x2019;s normal for the mother of a little toddler, especially in the midst of the busiest time of the year and a very special birthday celebration to boot. But I couldn&#x2019;t help wondering, &#x201c;How did I end up sitting on the floor, my bones aching, wondering whether I would be able to stand up again?&#x201d;</p><p>Andrew and I had waited a long time after marriage before deciding to start our family&#x2014;eleven years, in fact. So when I got pregnant, it came as just another challenge for the two of us in the midst of two very rich, very busy lives. Our careers were well established, our friendships were deep, and we were heavily engaged in our community. I was running one successful business while making plans to sell it, launching a separate consulting practice, and working on a master&#x2019;s degree in organization development, all at the same time. Yes, it felt hectic at times&#x2014;working on airplanes, juggling homework and client conferences, saying good night to my husband by telephone from halfway across the country. Andrew and I loved our lives just the way they were, and we had every intention of keeping them intact, baby or no.</p><p>When the news of my pregnancy was confirmed, I promptly decided that nothing was going to change in my life. In the months that followed, I was true to my word. I did not slow down at all during my pregnancy. I did not cut back on work, school, family, social, and community activities. I even kept up my usual exercise routine, including outdoor runs, right through my thirtieth week.</p><p>EC was born on December 16, and the three of us enjoyed a wonderful holiday season as a family in our home in Charlotte, North Carolina. By the end of January, I&#x2019;d resumed work on my master&#x2019;s degree and was back on an airplane headed to Phoenix to work with a client for a few days. My total time off after EC&#x2019;s birth: less than six weeks. I told myself, &#x201c;After all, if I don&#x2019;t keep pushing to build my business and make it successful, who will?&#x201d;</p><p>I maintained this pace for the entire first year of EC&#x2019;s life. I finished writing my master&#x2019;s thesis, continued to work with clients across the country, and stayed relentlessly focused on building my consulting business. And of course there was the adjustment to motherhood and the joy of being with EC as often as my crazy schedule would allow. I am lucky to have a wonderfully supportive husband who filled in for me as much as humanly possible&#x2014;but, yes, it was tiring. There were a few too many nights when my hours of sleep numbered four or five instead of seven or eight; a few too many jet-lagged evenings when I smiled at friends or colleagues over dinner table conversation without really hearing a word they&#x2019;d said.</p><p>By the time December rolled around again, I was running on fumes. I&#x2019;m sure that family and friends, and especially Andrew, were wondering when I planned on slowing down. But in my own mind, the plan was clear. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stop now!&#x201d; I thought. &#x201c;I have to plan EC&#x2019;s first birthday party, the holidays are coming up, I have a thesis to defend, and clients and employees to entertain.&#x201d;</p><p>But occasionally even I had to admit there were cracks showing in the fa�ade. I recall Andrew staring at me in concern one day that December as I was rushing to set the table for a dinner party we were hosting. &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; he finally said in a gentle tone of voice, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ve missed a few things this holiday season. Are you okay?&#x201d;</p><p>I was deeply shocked. I remember thinking, &#x201c;He says I&#x2019;ve missed a few things! Is that possible? I don&#x2019;t miss things! That&#x2019;s not who I am!&#x201d;<i> </i>When the denial finally wore off, I admitted to myself that of course he was right. I&#x2019;d forgotten to send a present to his grandmother in Kentucky. I&#x2019;d forgotten to call our favorite caterer to plan the holiday party for Andrew&#x2019;s work event until forty-eight hours before the event&#x2014;during their busiest time of year. I had even missed a conference call with a key client. With all these thoughts whirling in my head, I smiled reassuringly at Andrew, finished laying out the last place setting, and dashed off to tackle the rest of that afternoon&#x2019;s to-do list.</p><p>Somewhere inside me I was wondering, &#x201c;How many balls have I been dropping? And if Andrew has noticed, who else has noticed? Am I really out of control?&#x201d; But there was no time to focus on questions like those. I kept going at full speed&#x2014;or maybe a little bit faster.</p><p>I made it all the way through Christmas&#x2014;and then, on December 26, I crashed headfirst into the wall of my so-called life. And that&#x2019;s when I found myself sitting on the living room floor, staring up at the twinkling lights on the tree, oblivious to the sounds of EC and Andrew from some other room in our house, aching with an inner weariness unlike anything I&#x2019;d ever experienced before.</p><p>This was more than just physical fatigue or sleep deprivation. This was soul fatigue. I&#x2019;d achieved what I&#x2019;d wanted&#x2014;to keep my rich and busy life intact while being a new mom too. I&#x2019;d proven I could do it, and there was satisfaction in that. The image of a successful woman that I&#x2019;d always carried with me was that of a woman who was smart, driven, professionally accomplished, a Mary Poppins mom, a loving wife, a leader in the community&#x2014;and someone who made it all look effortless with her calm, impeccable style. That superwoman was the gold standard I&#x2019;d spent years trying to live up to. And in the past year, in some sense, I&#x2019;d achieved it.</p><p>But now, on December 26, I&#x2019;d woken up and realized I wasn&#x2019;t living. Not really.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t just that I was tired&#x2014;tired of trying to do it all, tired of trying to live up to some bogus notion of success. It was my memory of EC&#x2019;s first birthday, ten days before. As I sat there on the floor, I remembered watching EC blow out the candle on her first birthday cake, which was the size of a small castle&#x2014;one of those telltale symptoms of working-mom guilt. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it amazing?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d thought. &#x201c;I have a one-year-old daughter!&#x201d; And suddenly I&#x2019;d realized I couldn&#x2019;t remember a single significant detail or moment from her first year. EC was the single most important thing in my world&#x2014;and I was living a life that left me fundamentally out of touch with her.</p><p>Another memory popped into my head&#x2014;a conversation I&#x2019;d recently had with one of my closest friends, whose son had recently turned ten. &#x201c;I only have eight years left with him at home,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said with a sigh&#x2014;&#x201c;only eight more years.&#x201d; And now I&#x2019;d just missed the first year of my precious daughter&#x2019;s life. Was I going to blink and find myself suddenly celebrating EC&#x2019;s tenth birthday, wondering where all the time had gone?</p><p>That was the moment when everything changed for me. The moment when I knew it was time for me to reevaluate my life. Time to get real about who I was and who I wanted to be.</p><p>I&#x2019;d spent the past year frantically racing around the country to build my business. And what was the name of that business? Thinking about it, I didn&#x2019;t know whether to laugh or cry. My company is called Working Simply. I teach people how to work more simply, more purposefully&#x2014;to use smart planning to achieve much more with less effort.</p><p>Ironic? Yes, painfully so. But appropriate too. A wise woman once told me, &#x201c;We teach what we need to learn the most.&#x201d; Suddenly I grasped the full truth of that saying. Suddenly I realized how much I had to learn along with my clients.</p><p>I am very grateful that I woke up the day after Christmas, looked at my beautiful daughter and amazing husband, and decided that my busyness was no longer serving me. That the drive to achieve my idealized notion of success no longer served me. It came with a cost so high that I no longer chose to pay it.</p><p>And I realized that &#x201c;working simply&#x201d;&#x2014;the promise I make to my clients&#x2014;is about more than simply being efficient, well organized, and productive. It&#x2019;s about moving beyond being busy to reclaim purpose and meaning in life.</p><p>In the weeks that followed, I made a number of important changes in my life and work style. As I&#x2019;ll explain later in this book, those changes and others I&#x2019;ve made have profoundly enriched my life and my relationships with colleagues, clients, family, and friends. So now my work is more important to me than ever&#x2014;because I&#x2019;m on a mission. A mission to change the way we work and to support individuals, teams, and organizations in working smarter, not harder. A mission that I share with my clients.</p><p>If you&#x2019;ve ever found yourself in the same desperate place I was in that December 26, I hope you&#x2019;ll join me. To get started, please turn the page&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>Work Smarter, Not Harder</p><p>I SPENT NINE HOURS IN MEETINGS TODAY. MY E-MAIL INBOX has twenty-five thousand messages. I did not have time to use the restroom until 3 p.m. When I got home, my daughter threw my iPhone across the room and told me she was tired of me always being on it. It takes me hours to fall asleep at night because I cannot turn off my brain. I do not remember the last time I did something fun. I feel overwhelmed, stressed out, and frazzled. <i>My life is out of control.</i></p><p>Does this sound familiar? Life in the twenty-first century is busy! We have access to unprecedented amounts of information. We are connected to one another twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Technology has blurred the lines between professional life and personal life. We <i>can</i> do more, so we do.</p><p>Statistics confirm this reality. About a third of Americans who work full-time say they work more than fifty hours per week. According to the National Sleep Foundation, moms who work full-time and have school-aged children say they spend less than six hours in bed on weeknights. John de Graaf&#x2019;s handbook <i>Take Back Your Time</i> reported that dual-income couples say they can find only twelve minutes a day on average to talk to each other.1</p><p>This epidemic of busyness comes with a pervasive belief in time management. We tell ourselves that if only we could make better use of downtime (read e-mail in the elevator? At a stoplight? In the line for coffee?) or multitask more cleverly (I can do this conference call <i>and </i>walk the dog <i>and</i> pick up the laundry), we&#x2019;d get ahead of the busyness and reclaim our free time. But the stark reality is that we are not going to become any less busy. The demands on us at work, at home, from our friends, and from our community are not going to diminish&#x2014;if anything, they are only going to increase. As we work harder and harder, we invest more hours and energy trying to fight a losing battle. Something&#x2019;s got to give.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re reading this book, your efforts to solve your busyness problem have probably not paid off. As a result, you&#x2019;re probably feeling frustrated. Or worse&#x2014;you feel like a failure. Why can&#x2019;t you stop procrastinating? Why can&#x2019;t you get more done? Why isn&#x2019;t your inbox under control?</p><p>The truth is that the problem is not you. It is <i>how</i> you are trying to overcome your busyness that is the problem.</p><p>THE MYTH OF TIME MANAGEMENT</p><p>Within weeks of starting my first job out of college, I was sent to the in-house time management training program. Everyone in the entire organization attended the program, which was designed by a world-famous company that specialized in time management strategies. On the first day, the instructor handed out a planner and instructed us to use it to plan our tasks. We were told to prioritize our tasks, using numbers and letters, and record them on the left-hand side of the page in the planner on the date when they were to be completed. If a task was not completed on the designated day, we were instructed to move it to the next day by rewriting it on the left-hand side of the next day&#x2019;s page in the planner.</p><p>I dutifully attended the class and used the planner as instructed. But as the weeks went by, I noticed that my productivity hadn&#x2019;t seemed to improve. The time I spent filling out the pages in the planner felt like a needless waste. And I wasn&#x2019;t the only one. As I looked around at my colleagues, I noticed that many of them were really struggling with the system. Busyness, stress, and the feeling of being overwhelmed quickly crept back into our lives.</p><p>What happened? Now that we were armed with the secrets of a popular time management program and its specially designed planner, why weren&#x2019;t we all productive, efficient employees living balanced, purpose-filled lives?</p><p>The reason is simple: Time management programs do not work. Such programs teach a process focused almost entirely on how to plan and exercise control over the amount of time spent on a specific task or activity&#x2014;for example, &#x201c;Set aside adequate time to prepare the quarterly sales report before your meeting with your manager.&#x201d; This stems from the erroneous belief that poor allocation of time impairs performance. But such a one-dimensional approach does not account for the reality of work today, which is multifaceted, fast-paced, and constantly changing.</p><p>For example, at many companies, corporate goals are often only broadly specified. When I worked for a hospital foundation, one of the corporate goals was to be the preferred provider for cardiac care in the region. I worked in development and was not directly or indirectly responsible for providing patient care. So how did I organize my time to support the company&#x2019;s goal? I focused on employee giving and exceeding the target for our annual fund, which supported the operational budget of the hospital. As an employee, you must ascertain how to align your individual goals to the larger organizational goals. The numerous demands placed on you require that you not only increase your efforts but, more important, deploy those efforts wisely&#x2014;otherwise the increased effort is not translated into performance gains.</p><p>Time management training is not going to teach you how to work more productively. And that explains why time management training in fact has not been proven to have a direct impact on performance.2</p><p>If you want some fi...</p></p><h2>Steadfast Love: The Response of God to the Cries of Our Heart</h2><p>"Sometimes He wrings the worship from our hearts."&nbsp;There are times when worship overflows easily and effortlessly from a heart full of gratitude and praise. Yet, there are other times when God seems far and we feel we have nothing left to offer. We are tired, or thirsty, or imprisoned in our own chains through our own devices, or caught in the waves of a tumultuous sea. This is when God shows us His steadfast love.&nbsp;He wraps His eternally powerful, ultimately creative, nail-scarred hands around our hearts and squeezes with appropriate might&#x2014;yielding an honest plea for Him to save us and deliver us from our circumstances, fears, and self control. And He does. He initiates with His steadfast love, and responds with the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk with Lauren as she shares what she has learned of the steadfast love of the Lord.</p><p><b>Lauren Chandler</b> is a wife and mother of three. Her husband, Matt Chandler, serves as the lead teaching pastor at The Village Church in Dallas, Texas. Lauren is passionate about writing, music and leading worship, not only at The Village Church, but also for groups across the country. The Lord has taken Matt and Lauren on a challenging journey, beginning with the November 2009 discovery of a malignant brain tumor in Matt. The Lord has been infinitely merciful to provide peace and comfort in uncertainty, and joy in times of victory and healing. Lauren and her family have been given a deeper trust in clinging to the Lord and his cross during this appointed season of valleys and storms.<br>I had the privilege to get to know and love Lauren Chandler at the height of the season when God was wringing worship from her heart. I saw her cling to Him for dear life and resolve to trust Him amid terrifying circumstances. I also saw the very worship she describes in these pages surface in exquisite beauty. I am deeply grateful God put her pen to the page to share with us what He's shown her and taught her in Psalm 107. Lauren has encountered the steadfast love of God vividly and powerfully. Within these pages, we are invited to do the same. Lauren's tremendous gifting is obvious from first to last. She devours the Scriptures and makes us hungry for them, too. This is a gorgeous book. For all our sakes, I hope and trust it won't be her last.<br> &#x2014;Beth Moore<br><br><br>The steadfast love of God is a powerful balm for our souls, whether in the mundane details of daily life or in the deepest valleys through which we may be required to walk. I've watched as Lauren Chandler has clung to His faithfulness, goodness, and love in the midst of desperate places and have witnessed the sweet fruit as she has tethered her heart to the truth about His character and ways. Regardless of where you may find yourself in this season,&nbsp;<i>Steadfast Love&nbsp;</i>will&nbsp;be a means of sweet encouragement and grace.<br> &#x2014;Nancy Leigh DeMoss<br><br><br>"You can hear it in Lauren&#x2019;s words in these pages you&#x2019;re holding in your own hand, even as you hear the thunder of your own rising waves, what she knows from riding out her own tsunami: Wisdom isn&#x2019;t a function of considering great amounts of <i>knowledge</i>&#x2014; it&#x2019;s the wise who continually consider the great, <i>steadfast love of God</i>."<br><br>-Ann Voskamp</p><h2>Caught&#39;ya!

Indeed, there is hardly anything produced by knowledgeable numismatists that is easily accessible to the academic community at large or the interested lay reader. <em>The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Coinage</em> will fill this gap by providing a systematic overview of the major coinages of the classical world. The <em>Handbook</em> begins with a general introduction by volume editor William E. Metcalf followed by an article establishing the history and role of scientific analysis in ancient numismatics. The subsequent thirty-two chapters, all written by an international group of distinguished scholars, cover a vast geography and chronology, beginning with the first evidence of coins in Western Asia Minor in the seventh century BCE and continuing up to the transformation of coinage at the end of the Roman Empire. In addition to providing the essential background and current research questions of each of the major coinages, the <em>Handbook</em> also includes articles on the application of numismatic evidence to the disciplines of archaeology, economic history, art history, and ancient history. With helpful appendices, a glossary of specialized terms, indices of mints, persons, and general topics, and nearly 900 illustrations, <em>The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Coinage</em> will be an indispensable resource for scholars and students of the classical world, as well as a stimulating reference for collectors and interested lay readers.<br></p><p><br><strong>William E. Metcalf </strong>is Professor of Classics at Yale University and Ben Lee Damsky Curator of Coins and Medals at the University's Art Gallery.<br>"As Metcalf notes (xvii), it is over 100 years since the last single volume guide to Greek coinage was produced, and there has never been an equivalent work for Rome. This new handbook is, therefore, long overdue and hugely welcome. All involved are to be congratulated and, while in a project<br>as broad as this there are inevitably some omissions, we now have something where there was nothing, and for that we should be very gratefulEL. It is much to be hoped that students of the history of all periods will find their way to this rich new resource."<br><br>--Andrew Meadows, Bryn Mawr Classical Review<br><br>"This book represents an unprecedented innovation in numismatic literature and is becoming widely regarded as the best introduction to classical ancient coins. It is far more than a guide written solely for collectors. Instead, it was written to serve also as an introduction for graduate or<br>post-doctoral students in the ancient cultures who seek training in classical numismatics. As a work in the renowned Oxford Handbooks series, this volume was written to offer an authoritative and annotated state-of-the-art survey of current thinking and research in the subject area.

While some find it difficult to view humans as mere machines, molecular biologists maintain that most behavior is genetically based. Even skeptics and opponents agree that molecular biology may well change the way we all live in the 21st century. Little-known outside this exploding field, Seymour Benzer, his mentors, and his generations of students have studied the common fruit fly, <i>Drosophila</i>, and discovered genes that seem to have some influence upon our internal clock, our sexuality, and our ability to learn from our experiences.<p> Weiner (whose last book, <i>The Beak of the Finch</i>, won a Pulitzer Prize) has written an affectionate history about the development of the science while offering charming glimpses of the people involved--trading haircuts to stretch their grant money in the early years, roaming the laboratory into the wee hours, naming the genes associated with learning after Pavlov's dogs. It's not all sweetness and light, however; ethical questions are raised, some of the hype (and hysteria) surrounding the human genome project is dissipated, and the complicated "clockwork" gene "looks less like an invitation to human intervention and more like a cautionary tale or object lesson for anyone who might try, in the 21st century, to improve on nature's four-billion-year-old designs." That said, the scientists in Weiner's tale reveal a very human side of this fast-moving science, and their belief that they'll find answers to important questions is contagious and compelling.

His father was Secretary to the Royal Treasury and a minor noble, and his mother was a devoutly religious woman who died when he was a child. Calder�n studied canon law in preparation for his presumed career in the church, but in the 1620s he started to write verse, and his success in competitions attracted attention. The first known staging of one of his plays was a 1623 performance of <i>Amor, Honor, Poder</i> (<i>Love, Honor, and Power</i>). Eventually, the prolific Calder�n would write approximately 120 full-length dramatic works, 80 one-act autos sacramentales (religious mystery plays), and many other short pieces of poetry and theater. In 1636 King Philip IV named him a knight of the Order of Santiago. His output lessened in the 1640s, and in 1651 Calder�n entered the priesthood, becoming chaplain of the Capilla de los Reyes Nuevos at the cathedral in Toledo, and then, in 1656, head of the congregation of San Pedro in Madrid.

Purgatorio</em> is the second volume in this set and opens with Dante the poet picturing Dante the pilgrim coming out of the pit of hell. Similar to the <em>Inferno</em> (34 cantos), this volume is divided into 33 cantos, written in tercets (groups of 3 lines). The English prose is arranged in tercets to facilitate easy correspondence to the verse form of the Italian on the facing page, enabling the reader to follow both languages line by line. In an effort to capture the peculiarities of Dante's original language, this translation strives toward the literal and sheds new light on the shape of the poem. Again the text of <em>Purgatorio</em> follows Petrocchi's <em>La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata</em>, but the editor has departed from Petrocchi's readings in a number of cases, somewhat larger than in the previous <em>Inferno</em>, not without consideration of recent critical readings of the <em>Comedy</em> by scholars such as Lanza (1995, 1997) and Sanguineti (2001). As before, Petrocchi's punctuation has been lightened and American norms have been followed. However, without any pretensions to being "critical", the text presented here is electic and being not persuaded of the exclusive authority of any manuscript, the editor has felt free to adopt readings from various branches of the stemma. One major addition to this second volume is in the notes, where is found the <em>Intercantica</em> - a section for each canto that discusses its relation to the <em>Inferno</em> and which will make it easier for the reader to relate the different parts of the <em>Comedy</em> as a whole.<br></p><p>Mr. Sinclair&#39;s three-volume prose translation of Dante&#39;s Divine Comedy should prove to be an invaluable source of pleasure to those English readers who would read this great medieval classic with understanding. The original Italian text and the Sinclair translation are arranged on facing pages, and the commentaries, brilliant examples of genuine literary criticism, appear after each canto.<br><strong>Robert M. Durling</strong> is Professor Emeritus of English and Italian Literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz. <strong>Ronald L. Martinez</strong> is Professor of Italian at Brown University.

The Kingfisher Science Encyclopedia is the one reference that includes all of the information students need to know in today's fast-paced world. Clearly written and illustrated articles provide in-depth insight and concise authoritative information. An impressive reference section at the end of the book contains minibiographies of famous scientists, plus an illustrated time line of key inventions and discoveries. Arranged thematically into ten chapters, with reference summaries at the end of each chapter and a full index, the encyclopedia does more than merely provide facts about science and technology&#x2015;it helps the reader think for him or herself, develop an enquiring mind, pose challenging questions, and explore new topics.</p><p><p>Professor Charles Taylor received the U.K.'s Bragg Medal and Prize of Institutional Physics, and the UK's Michael Faraday Award for contributions to the public understanding of science. He has presented lectures on BBC television and has written many science books for children.</p>A popular science resource last published in 2000 has received a small dose of updating. Arrangement is topical, with 10 chapters covering subjects such as "Planet Earth," "Human Biology," and "Conservation and the Environment." Within chapters, following a brief introduction, an average of 27 entries cover a variety of smaller topics. Most entries extend over two pages and are equal parts text and colorful photographs, drawings, diagrams, cutaways, and other illustrations that are sure to draw interest. Each chapter closes with a page of "Facts and Figures." All topics are cross-referenced to entries containing related material.<p>A "Ready Reference" section in the back of the volume includes units of measurement, conversion tables, geometric shapes, and brief descriptions of important scientists and discoveries. A two-page glossary has a sidebar devoted to computer terms.</p><p>The topical arrangement makes a good table of contents and index essential. The table of contents is clearly laid out and easy to browse, but students may be frustrated by the index. Fourteen page references are provided for <i>telescope</i> and six for <i>television,</i>for example, but the pages for the sections that specifically deal with these topics are not called out in any way.</p><p>We found most evidence of updating in the "Space and Time" chapter, where small portions of text related to space exploration have been revised, and the number of moons in the solar system has been changed to reflect recent discoveries. Changes have been made to the "Facts and Figures" pages; for example, several lists of "Key Dates" now include twenty-first-century advances. Providing students with current science material is essential, and though the volume has not been extensively revised, libraries should acquire it to replace the previous version. This attractive, browsable, reasonably priced encyclopedia definitely has a place beside titles offering more depth, such as the six-volume <i>New Book of Popular Science</i>. <i>Mary Ellen Quinn</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He began inventing these stories in his American wife&#39;s hometown of Brattleboro, Vermont, to amuse his eldest daughter--and they have served ever since as a source of laughter for children everywhere.<br> <br> <b>Joseph Rudyard Kipling</b> was an English journalist, short-story writer, poet, and novelist. <br> <br> Kipling's works of fiction include <i>The Jungle Book</i> (1894), <i>Kim</i> (1901), and many short stories, including <i>"The Man Who Would Be King"</i> (1888). His poems include <i>"Mandalay" (1890), "Gunga Din" (1890), "The Gods of the Copybook Headings" (1919), "The White Man's Burden" (1899)</i>, and <i>"If&#x2014;"</i> (1910). He is regarded as a major innovator in the art of the short story; his children's books are classics of children's literature, and one critic described his work as exhibiting "a versatile and luminous narrative gift". <br> <br> Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the United Kingdom, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Henry James said: "Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius (as distinct from fine intelligence) that I have ever known." In 1907, at the age of 41, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and its youngest recipient to date. He was also sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, both of which he declined. <br> <br> Awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907 "in consideration of the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration which characterize the creations of this world-famous author." <br> <br> Kipling kept writing until the early 1930s, but at a slower pace and with much less success than before. On the night of 12 January 1936, Kipling suffered a haemorrhage in his small intestine. He underwent surgery, but died less than a week later on 18 January 1936 at the age of 70 of a perforated duodenal ulcer. Kipling's death had in fact previously been incorrectly announced in a magazine, to which he wrote, "I've just read that I am dead.

Cook Following the success of Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby was hailed as a comic triumph and firmly established Dickens as a &#39;literary gentleman&#39;. It has a full supporting cast of delectable characters that range from the iniquitous Wackford Squeers and his family, to the delightful Mrs Nickleby, taking in the eccentric Crummles and his travelling players, the Mantalinis, the Kenwigs and many more. Combining these with typically Dickensian elements of burlesque and farce, the novel is eminently suited to dramatic adaptation. So great was the impact as it left Dickens&#39; pen that many pirated versions appeared in print before the original was even finished. Often neglected by critics, Nicholas Nickleby has never ceased to delight readers and is widely regarded as one of the greatest comic masterpieces of nineteenth-centure literature.</p><p><i>Hodder Headline Audiobooks</i> presents abridged readings of some of the finest in drama, classic literature, popular fiction, poetry, children�s stories, and religious and inspirational works. Among Hodder Headline�s outstanding cast of readers and performers are Kenneth Branagh, Juliet Stevenson, Simon Callow, Stephen Fry, and Dame Judi Dench. Each set of cassettes is beautifully packaged and shrink-wrapped.Charles Dickens had an understanding of mid-Victorian society second to none, and genius and energy massive enough to make the absurdities and terrors of that society come alive on the page. Nicholas Nickleby, with its episodes of chicanery in finance and education, and the dramatic intensity with which it tells the story of its open-hearted protagonists - a young brother and sister at sea in a dangerous world - and its frightening villain, the magnificently rendered Ralph Nickleby, represents Dickens at his clear-eyed, indignant and mesmerizing best.</p><h2>Beginning Algebra (5th Edition)</h2><p>This clear, accessible treatment of mathematics features a building-block approach toward problem solving, realistic and diverse applications, and chapter organizer to help users focus their study and become effective and confident problem solvers.

For over thirty years we have taught mathematics courses at North Shore Community College. Each semester we join you in the daily task of sharing the knowledge of mathematics with students who often struggle with this subject. We enjoy teaching and helping students&#x2014;and we are confident that you share these joys with us. </p> <p> Mathematics instructors and students face many challenges today. <i>Beginning Algebra</i> was written with these needs in mind. This textbook explains mathematics slowly, clearly, and in a way that is relevant to everyday life for the college student. As with previous editions, special attention has been given to problem solving in the fifth edition. This text is written to help students organize the information in any problem-solving situation, to reduce anxiety, and to provide a guide that enables students to become confident problem solvers. </p> <p> One of the hallmark characteristics of <i>Beginning Algebra</i> that makes the text easy to learn and teach from is the building-block organization. Each section is written to stand on its own, and each homework set is completely self-testing. Exercises are paired and graded and are of varying levels and types to ensure that all skills and concepts are covered. As a result, the text offers students an effective and proven learning program suitable for a variety of course formats-including lecture-based classes; discussion-oriented classes; distance learning centers; modular, self-paced courses; mathematics laboratories; and computer-supported centers. </p> <p> <i>Beginning Algebra</i> is part of a series that includes the following: </p> Tobey/Slater, <i>Basic College Mathematics,</i> Fourth Edition<br> Blair/Tobey/Slater, <i>Prealgebra,</i> Second Edition<br> Tobey/Slater, <i>Beginning Algebra,</i> Fifth Edition<br> Tobey/Slater, <i>Intermediate Algebra,</i> Fourth Edition<br> Tobey/Slater, <i>Beginning and Intermediate Algebra</i> <p> We have visited and listened to teachers across the country and have incorporated a number of suggestions into this edition to help you with the particular learning delivery system at your school. The following pages describe the key continuing features and changes in the fifth edition. </p> <p><b>Key Features and Changes in the Fifth Edition</b></p> <p><b>Developing Problem-Solving Abilities</b></p> <p> We are committed as authors to producing a textbook that emphasizes mathematical reasoning and problem-solving techniques as recommended by AMATYC, NCTM, AMS, NADE, MAA, and other bodies. To this end, the problem sets are built on a wealth of real-life and real-data applications. Unique problems have been developed and incorporated into the exercise sets that help train students in data interpretation, mental mathematics, estimation, geometry and graphing, number sense, critical thinking, and decision making. </p> <p><b>More Applied Problems</b></p> <p> The exercises and applications have been extensively revised. Numerous real-world and real-data application problems show students the relevance of the math they are learning. The applications relate to everyday life, global issues beyond the borders of the United States, and other academic disciplines. Many include source citations. The number of real-data applications has significantly increased. Roughly 30 percent of the applications have been contributed by actual students based on scenario they have encountered in their home or work lives. </p> <p><b>Math in the Media</b></p> <p> New Math in the Media applications appear at the end of each chapter to offer students yet another opportunity to see why developing mastery of mathematical concepts enhances their understanding of the world around them. The applications are based on a brief clip, illustration, or information from familiar media sources&#x2014;either online or print. The exercises may ask students to interpret or verify information, perform calculations, make decisions or predictions, or provide a rationale for their responses. </p> <p><b>Putting Your Skills to Work Applications</b></p> <p> This highly successful feature has been revised in the fifth edition. There are 10 new Putting Your Skills to Work applications in the new edition. These nonroutine application problems challenge students to synthesize the knowledge they have gained and apply it to a totally new area. Each problem is specifically arranged for independent and cooperative learning or group investigation of mathematical problems that pique student interest. Students are given the opportunity to help one another discover mathematical solutions to extended problems. The investigations feature open-ended questions and extrapolation of data to areas beyond what is normally covered in such a course. </p> <p><b>Internet Connections</b></p> <p> As an integral part of each Putting Your Skills to Work problem, students are exposed to an interesting application of the Internet and encouraged to continue their investigations. This use of technology inspires students to have confidence in their abilities to successfully use mathematics. In the fifth edition, the Internet Connections have been completely revised and updated. </p> <p> The companion Web site (<b>http://www.prenhall.com/tobey_beginning</b>) now features annotated links to help students navigate the sites more efficiently and to provide a more user-friendly experience. </p> <p><b>Increased Integration and Emphasis on Geometry</b></p> <p> Due to the emphasis on geometry on many statewide exams, geometry problems are integrated throughout the text. The new edition contains over approximately 35 percent more geometry problems. Additionally, examples and exercises that incorporate a principle of geometry are now marked with a triangle icon for easy identification. </p> <p><b>Blueprint for Problem Solving</b></p> <p> The successful Mathematics Blueprint for Problem Solving strengthens problem-solving skills by providing a consistent and interactive outline to help students organize their approach to problem solving. Once students fill in the blueprint, they can refer back to their plan as they do what is needed to solve the problem. Because of its flexibility, this feature can be used with single-step problems, multistep problems, applications, and nonroutine problems that require problem-solving strategies. Students will not need to use the blueprint to solve every problem. It is available for those faced with a problem with which they are not familiar, to alleviate anxiety, to show them where to begin, and to assist them in the steps of reasoning. </p> <p><b>Developing Your Study Skills</b></p> <p> This highly successful feature has been retained in the new edition. The boxed notes are integrated throughout the text to provide students with techniques for improving their study skills and succeeding in math courses. </p> <p><b>Graphs, Charts, and Tables</b></p> <p> When students encounter mathematics in real-world publications, they often encounter data represented in a graph, chart, or table and are asked to make a reasonable conclusion based on the data presented. This emphasis on graphical interpretation is a continuing trend with the expanding technology of our day. The number of mathematical problems based on charts, graphs, and tables has been significantly increased in this edition. Students are asked to make simple interpretations, to solve medium-level problems, and to investigate challenging applied problems based on the data shown in a chart, graph, or table. </p> <p><b>New Design</b></p> <p> The fifth edition has a new design that enhances the accessible, student-friendly writing style. This new design includes new chapter opening applications and an improved and enhanced art program. See the walkthrough of features in the preface. </p> <p><b>Mastering Mathematical Concepts</b></p> <p> Text features that develop the mastery of concepts include the following: </p> <p><b>Learning Objectives</b></p> <p> Concise learning objectives listed at the beginning of each section allow students to preview the goals of that section. </p> <p><b>Examples and Exercises</b></p> <p> The examples and exercises in this text have been carefully chosen to guide students through <i>Beginning Algebra.</i> We have incorporated several different types of exercises and examples to assist your students in retaining the content of this course. </p> <p><b>Chapter Pretests</b></p> <p> Each chapter opens with a concise pretest to familiarize the students with the learning objectives for that particular chapter. The problems are keyed to appropriate sections of the chapter. All answers appear in the back of the book. </p> <p><b>Practice Problems</b></p> <p> Practice problems are found throughout the chapter, after the examples, and are designed to provide your students with immediate practice of the skills presented. The complete worked-out solution of each practice problem appears in the back of the book. </p> <p><b>To Think About</b></p> <p> These critical thinking questions follow some of the examples in the text and also appear in the exercise sets. They extend the concept being taught, providing the opportunity for all students to stretch their minds, to look for patterns, and to make conclusions based on their previous experience. The new edition includes an increased number of these problems. </p> <p><b>Exercise Sets</b></p> <p> Exercise sets are paired and graded. This design helps ease the students into the problems, and the answers provide students with immediate feedback. </p> <p><b>Cumulative Review Problems</b></p> <p> Each exercise set concludes with a section of cumulative review problems. These problems review topics previously covered and are designed to assist students in retaining the material. Many additional applied problems have been added to the cumulative review sections. </p> <p><b>Graphing and Scientific Calculator Problems</b></p> <p> Calculator boxes are placed in the margin of the text to alert students to a scientific or graphing calculator application.

All he knows is that he wants vengeance against the vicious, arrogant aristocrat who brutally murdered his best friend. As France plummets into revolution at the end of the eighteenth century, Moreau's journey toward revenge takes him through several careers, from lawyer to fugitive to actor and playwright&#x2015;and eventually to member of the French National Assembly. Hiding with a troupe of itinerant actors, he gleefully plays the traditional Commedia Dell-Arte role of Scaramouche, the trouble-making trickster who, like Shakespeare's fools and jesters, speaks painful truths disguised as harmless comedy. &amp;&amp;LP&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RRafael Sabatini&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R was a twentieth-century Alexandre Dumas: a masterful creator of swashbuckling historical romances. Mixing real people with fictional characters and actual events with invented ones, Sabatini drew vivid, accurately detailed pictures of revolution-addled France. In Scaramouche, he turns a sweeping adventure epic into a subtle psychological study, as Moreau's odyssey gradually becomes less about revenge than about self-discovery.&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/DIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RIncludes 8 pieces of original art.&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/DIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LB&amp;&amp;RJohn D.

And for hardly a moment thereafter does Andr�-Louis Moreau lose his charismatic cool, displaying at almost every turn in the tumultuous course of his picaresque adventures the verve, the wit, the intellectual and physical adroitness, and the instant mastery of circumstance that are his birthright. Thrust by chance into the turbulent politics of the time, his successive endeavors as a lawyer, politician, actor, lover, and buffoon make for corking entertainment. With colorful set-pieces playing against a backdrop of high historical drama, &#34;Scaramouche&#34; is considered by many to be Sabatini&#39;s best work.<b>John D.

Netter&#39;s works, this fully illustrated single book from the 8-volume/13-book reference collection includes: hundreds of world-renowned illustrations by Frank H. Netter, MD; informative text by recognized medical experts; anatomy, physiology, and pathology; and diagnostic and surgical procedures.</p><p><p>Frank H. Netter was born in New York City in 1906. He studied art at the Art Students League and the National Academy of Design before entering medical school at New York University, where he received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1931. During his student years, Dr. Netter&#x2019;s notebook sketches attracted the attention of the medical faculty and other physicians, allowing him to augment his income by illustrating articles and textbooks. He continued illustrating as a sideline after establishing a surgical practice in 1933, but he ultimately opted to give up his practice in favor of a full-time commitment to art. After service in the United States Army during World War II, Dr. Netter began his long collaboration with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company (now Novartis Pharmaceuticals). This 45-year partnership resulted in the production of the extraordinary collection of medical art so familiar to physicians and other medical professionals worldwide. Icon Learning Systems acquired the Netter Collection in July 2000 and continued to update Dr. Netter&#x2019;s original paintings and to add newly commissioned paintings by artists trained in the style of Dr. Netter. In 2005, Elsevier Inc. purchased the Netter Collection and all publications from Icon Learning Systems. There are now over 50 publications featuring the art of Dr. Netter available through Elsevier Inc.</p> <p>Dr. Netter&#x2019;s works are among the finest examples of the use of illustration in the teaching of medical concepts. The 13-book Netter Collection of Medical Illustrations, which includes the greater part of the more than 20,000 paintings created by Dr. Netter, became and remains one of the most famous medical works ever published. The Netter Atlas of Human Anatomy, first published in 1989, presents the anatomic paintings from the Netter Collection. Now translated into 16 languages, it is the anatomy atlas of choice among medical and health professions students the world over.</p> <p>The Netter illustrations are appreciated not only for their aesthetic qualities, but, more importantly, for their intellectual content. As Dr. Netter wrote in 1949 &#x201c;clarification of a subject is the aim and goal of illustration. No matter how beautifully painted, how delicately and subtly rendered a subject may be, it is of little value as a medical illustration if it does not serve to make clear some medical point. Dr. Netter&#x2019;s planning, conception, point of view, and approach are what inform his paintings and what make them so intellectually valuable.</p> <p>Frank H. Netter, MD, physician and artist, died in 1991.</p></p><h2>Secret Lives of Walter Mitty and of James Thurber (Wonderfully Illustrated Short Pieces)</h2><p><p>The WISP series (short for Wonderfully Illustrated Short Pieces) represents an ingenious marriage of two creative forces: the artistry of today's foremost children's book illustrators and the literary legacy of beloved authors of popular short works for adults.

More than 130 extraordinary photographs, taken during a year-long assignment in the region by award-winning photographer and naturalist Frans Lanting, capture with powerful immediacy the beauty and drama of Africa&#39;s breathtaking Okavango Delta. Spreading over 8,600 square miles, this vast wetland in the heart of the Kalahari supports an unparalleled diversity of wildlife. From its origins in the highlands of Angola, the Okavango River descends to the near-desert of northern Botswana, where it fans out as the world&#39;s largest inland delta; an ecosystem of a size and complexity rivaling any on earth, a rare place where desert and swamp dwellers meet. Hippos, crocodiles, zebra, impalas, buffalo, giraffe, lions, hyenas, and the continent&#39;s largest unharassed elephant population find refuge and replenishment in the seasonal ebb and flow of fresh water into the delta. Together, Lanting&#39;s words and images tell of the dynamic movement of water throughout the year and of the rhythms of flora and fauna in response to it; of the spectacular array of wild creatures; of the people who live in this frontier region; and, finally, in a thoughtful epilogue, of the difficult environmental challenges faced by this complex natural system and its hopeful future as a place where Africa&#39;s free-roaming wildlife stands a chance of surviving intact into the twenty-first century. No other photographer has captured the variety of Africa&#39;s wildlife and the richness of its landscape with such vividness, sympathy, and skill. Okavango is an unforgettable portrait of Africa&#39;s remarkable primeval oasis.</p><p>Beautifully laid out and superbly printed, &#34;Okavango&#34; is a multi-level, multi-layered feast. &#34; Washington Post&#34; In documenting the cycles of Okavango, Lanting&#39;s photographic skills are seemingly boundless. &#34;Library Journal&#34;Frans Lanting is critically acclaimed as one of the world&#39;s great outdoor photographers. His work has appeared primarily in National Geographic, and he has several other books to his credit. Lanting was born in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and now lives in Monterey Bay, California.</p><h2>The Economy of Nature</h2><p><p>This classic introductory text is best known for its vivid examples fromnatural history, comprehensive coverage of evolution, and quantitative approach.

Fully integrated activities are found in her accompanying Activities Manual, which comes with every new copy of the text. As a result, students engage, explore, discuss, and ultimately reach a true understanding of mathematics. The newActive Teachers, Active Learners DVD helps instructors enrich their classroom by expanding their knowledge of teaching using an inquiry-based approach. The DVD shows Beckmann and her students discovering various concepts, along with voiceover commentary from Beckmann. This DVD is the ideal resource for instructors who are teaching with an inquiry-based approach for the first time, and for instructors who seek new ideas to integrate into their course. The table of contents is organized by operation rather than number type to foster a more unified understanding of the math concepts. Throughout the text, students learn why the math works, rather than just the mechanics of how it works. In this new edition the contents have been updated and rearranged for a more natural organization.</p><p>Sybilla Beckmann earned her undergraduate degree in mathematics from Brown University and a PhD in mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania. She taught and did research in mathematics at Yale University for two years. Since then, she has been at the University of Georgia. When she had children, she became very interested in helping prospective teachers understand and appreciate the mathematics they will teach. This interest led to her book. In her spare time, she enjoys playing the piano, weaving, attending classical music concerts, and traveling with her family.</p><h2>True And False Allegations Of Child Sexual Abuse: Assessment &amp; Case Management</h2><p>First published in 1995. Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p>The task of assessing an alleged case of sexual abuse is formidable. In fact, many studies have found that assessments are often inaccurate: either child victims are not acknowledged or alleged offenders are being falsely accused. The consequences of an inaccurately assessed allegation can have devastating and long-lasting effects on a child victim, an alleged offender, other family members, and society in general. True and False Allegations of Child Sexual Abuse is the first volume to address, through the expertise of a diverse group of scholars and practitioners, current research and the clinical, legal, and ethical issues that arise in sexual abuse cases. The volume places particular emphasis on improving the assessment and case management of all allegations. Written for both students and professionals involved in child sexual abuse assessment and management, the book aims to translate complex research issues into comprehensible and sound recommendations for practice. It also offers useful strategies and techniques in assessment and case management, particularly where information inconsistencies exist.</p><h2>Mastering Miracles: The Healing Art of Qi Gong As Taught by a Master</h2><p>A Chinese physician explains the herbal, exercise, and meditation practices of Qi Gong, showing how to use the body&#39;s energies to prevent disease and achieve a state of good health.</p><p>Liu is a Chinese physician and Qi Gong master who believes that he was chosen to bring Eastern and Western systems of medicine together into a complementary whole. Now practicing traditional therapies in California, Liu tells his story with the help of Perry, who coauthored the best-selling Saved by the Light (Wheeler, 1991; Random, 1994. reprint) with Dannion Brinkley. Partly biological, partly philosophical, and partly prescriptive, the book is written in the first person, which gives it a casual feel. The somewhat overly long first half describes Liu's quest to become a Qi Gong master. The second half is a more clinical description of the Qi Gong process, which uses a patient's own energy fields to achieve a state of "radiant health," or wellness, with a regimen of diet, exercise, and herbal remedies assisting in the process. Liu illustrates his method with case studies and includes recipes for healing foods. Qi Gong may seem odd to Western sensibilities, but Liu is careful to point out that it should be undertaken in conjunction with standard medical treatments and with the knowledge of a physician. Recommended for libraries with a large alternative medicine collection or where demand is high.?Betty Braaksma, Thunder Bay P.L., Ontario<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.In the first third of this book, Liu tells how he was instructed in one type of Chinese healing by Master Kwan, who lived in a three-room mountaintop cave and looked on the difficult climb to it as a test of motivation for patients, students, and apprentices. Kwan's striking diagnoses--achieved apparently by using only his eyes--Liu shows to be neither paranormal nor miraculous but the result of intense study and long experience. Once Liu learned the lesson of humility, Kwan became teacher rather than taskmaster. Later, when Liu, having taken his M.D., worked in a Western-style Shanghai hospital, he gradually brought his bosses around to believing Chinese medicine had much to offer. In the book's remaining two-thirds, Liu reports on several cases to show how he thinks and works; relays many herbal recipes; and describes, with illustrations, helpful exercises for both patients and those desirous of keeping good health. Liu seems to understand himself and other people, and he urges a close relationship between Chinese and Western medicines. <i>William Beatty</i></p><h2>The Politics of the Veil (The Public Square)</h2><p><p>In 2004, the French government instituted a ban on the wearing of "conspicuous signs" of religious affiliation in public schools. Though the ban applies to everyone, it is aimed at Muslim girls wearing headscarves. Proponents of the law insist it upholds France's values of secular liberalism and regard the headscarf as symbolic of Islam's resistance to modernity. <i>The Politics of the Veil</i> is an explosive refutation of this view, one that bears important implications for us all.</p><br><p> Joan Wallach Scott, the renowned pioneer of gender studies, argues that the law is symptomatic of France's failure to integrate its former colonial subjects as full citizens. She examines the long history of racism behind the law as well as the ideological barriers thrown up against Muslim assimilation. She emphasizes the conflicting approaches to sexuality that lie at the heart of the debate--how French supporters of the ban view sexual openness as the standard for normalcy, emancipation, and individuality, and the sexual modesty implicit in the headscarf as proof that Muslims can never become fully French. Scott maintains that the law, far from reconciling religious and ethnic differences, only exacerbates them. She shows how the insistence on homogeneity is no longer feasible for France--or the West in general--and how it creates the very "clash of civilizations" said to be at the root of these tensions.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Politics of the Veil</i> calls for a new vision of community where common ground is found amid our differences, and where the embracing of diversity--not its suppression--is recognized as the best path to social harmony.</p></p><p><p>"Brilliant, crisp, and cogently argued. Joan W. Scott's novel and trenchant discursive analysis exposes the prejudices of the reductionist French versions of secularism and feminism regarding Islam and French Muslims from North African and Arab origins. The study is illuminating far beyond the French case, as former colonial and/or working subjects struggle for integration and recognition of their difference."<b>--Abdellah Hammoudi, Princeton University</b></p><p>"Carefully argued, insightful and humane, Joan Scott's <i>The Politics of the Veil</i> is far and away the best account of France's identity crisis that was signaled by the famous headscarf affair. The final chapter, on the symbolic meanings of the headscarf/veil, is the most original and brilliant piece of writing that I have read on this topic. This is an indispensable book, transcending the particularity of French obsessions and forcing the reader to think about wider political problems that concern us all."<b>--Talal Asad, author of <i>On Suicide Bombing</i></b></p><p>"Scott traces the history and politics of veil controversies in France and draws apart intertwined strands, starting with the legacy of racism from the colonial past. She persuasively argues for the negotiation of cultural and religious differences rather than their negation. This book will be required reading for all those concerned with the integration of Muslims into Western Christian societies."<b>--Beth Baron, author of <i>Egypt as a Woman: Nationalism, Gender, and Politics</i></b></p><p>"This is an important and timely book that will challenge the dominant terms used to debate the French government's ban on the veil in public schools. Through a careful analysis of historical and contemporary French discourse on Muslims and Arabs, Scott helps us see how the controversy over the veil is indexical of a deep paradox that haunts the ideology of French Republicanism of which the principle of la�cit� is a crucial part."<b>--Saba Mahmood, author of <i>Politics of Piety: The Islamic Revival and the Feminist Subject</i></b></p><b>Joan Wallach Scott</b> is the Harold F. Linder Professor in the School of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study. Her books include <i>Parite!: Sexual Equality and the Crisis of French Universalism</i> and <i>Gender and the Politics of History</i>.</p><h2>Paul Robeson</h2><p>Passionate and enormously talented, Paul Robeson lived one of the great lives of the twentieth century. Martin Duberman's classic biography is a monumental and powerfully affecting portrait of one of this century's most notable performers, political radicals, and champions of racial equality.<br>Drawing on a vast archive of family papers and interviews with friends and relatives as well as FBI files, Paul Robeson charts the heroic and tragic course of Robeson's life: from his early days as the son of a former slave to his rise to unprecedented international acclaim as a stage actor and singer, and from his political awakening to his downfall as a victim of McCarthyism and the efforts of the U.S. government to destroy him.</p><p>Martin Duberman is Distinguished Professor of History at the City University of New York.For millions of white Americans in the 1930s and early '40s, Paul = Robeson's success was a symbol that the American system worked. If this son of an ex-slave, this All-American football hero and concert singer could become a stage and screen starfamous as Othello and the Emperor Jonesthen couldn't any black person rise to the highest echelons through hard work? But when Robeson turned politically active, combining black militancy with support for the Stalinist Soviet Union and his own socialist vision, white Americaand many blacks tooturned their backs on him. The FBI kept him under close surveillance; the State Department restricted his right to travel. By 1960, he was branded as a public enemy, a Soviet apologist, and forced to the sidelines in civil-rights battles. His health and spirit broken, Robeson died in 1976, his reputation in eclipse. This big, engrossing, empathetic biography by distinguished historian-playwright Duberman is a major act of cultural restoration, forcing a fresh confrontation with Robeson's often highly independent political stances as well as his artistic creativity. Relying almost entirely on letters, diaries, interviews, FBI files and other primary sources, Duberman writes about Robeson's sexual affairs with white actresses, his shaky marriage, his deliberate cultivation of the image of "natural" actor and his fear that the U.S. would inherit the colonialist systems of Great Britain and France while its leaders pursued Cold War politics with the U.S.S.R.

Called <i>Din� Bi'�lta',</i> The People's School, in recognition of its status as the first American Indian community-controlled school, Rough Rock was the first to teach in the Native language and to produce a body of quality children's literature by and about Navajo people. These innovations have positioned the school as a leader in American Indian and bilingual/bicultural education and have enabled school participants to wield considerable influence on national policy. This book is a critical life history of this singular school and community. <br><br>McCarty's account grows out of 20 years of ethnographic work by the author with the <i>Din�</i> (Navajo) community of Rough Rock. The story is told primarily through written text, but also through the striking black-and-white images of photographer Fred Bia, a member of the Rough Rock community. Unlike most accounts of Indigenous schooling, this study involves the active participation of Navajo community members. Their oral testimony and that of other leaders in Indigenous/Navajo education frame and texture the account. <br><br>Informed by critical theories of education, this book is not just the story of a single school and community. It is also an inquiry into the larger struggle for self-determination by Indigenous and other minoritized communities, raising issues of identity, voice, and community empowerment. <i>A Place To Be Navajo</i> asks whether school can be a place where children learn, question, and grow in an environment that values and builds upon who they are. The author argues that the questions Rough Rock raises, and the responses they summon, implicate us all.<br></p><p></p>
